We present GLM-5, a next-generation foundation model designed to transition the paradigm of vibe coding to agentic engineering. Building upon the agentic, reasoning, and coding (ARC) capabilities of its predecessor, GLM-5 adopts DSA to significantly reduce training and inference costs while maintaining long-context fidelity. To advance model alignment and autonomy, we implement a new asynchronous reinforcement learning infrastructure that drastically improves post-training efficiency by decoupling generation from training. Furthermore, we propose novel asynchronous agent RL algorithms that further improve RL quality, enabling the model to learn from complex, long-horizon interactions more effectively. Through these innovations, GLM-5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on major open benchmarks. Most critically, GLM-5 demonstrates unprecedented capability in real-world coding tasks, surpassing previous baselines in handling end-to-end software engineering challenges. Code, models, and more information are available at https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-5.]]></description>

Agent Skills are structured packages of procedural knowledge that augment LLM agents at inference time. Despite rapid adoption, there is no standard way to measure whether they actually help. We present SkillsBench, a benchmark of 86 tasks across 11 domains paired with curated Skills and deterministic verifiers. Each task is evaluated under three conditions: no Skills, curated Skills, and self-generated Skills. We test 7 agent-model configurations over 7,308 trajectories. Curated Skills raise average pass rate by 16.2 percentage points(pp), but effects vary widely by domain (+4.5pp for Software Engineering to +51.9pp for Healthcare) and 16 of 84 tasks show negative deltas. Self-generated Skills provide no benefit on average, showing that models cannot reliably author the procedural knowledge they benefit from consuming. Focused Skills with 2--3 modules outperform comprehensive documentation, and smaller models with Skills can match larger models without them.]]></description>

Despite rapid progress in multimodal foundation models, embodied intelligence community still lacks a unified, physically grounded foundation model that integrates perception, reasoning, and planning within real-world spatial-temporal dynamics. We introduce RynnBrain, an open-source spatiotemporal foundation model for embodied intelligence. RynnBrain strengthens four core capabilities in a unified framework: comprehensive egocentric understanding, diverse spatiotemporal localization, physically grounded reasoning, and physics-aware planning. The RynnBrain family comprises three foundation model scales (2B, 8B, and 30B-A3B MoE) and four post-trained variants tailored for downstream embodied tasks (i.e., RynnBrain-Nav, RynnBrain-Plan, and RynnBrain-VLA) or complex spatial reasoning tasks (i.e., RynnBrain-CoP). In terms of extensive evaluations on 20 embodied benchmarks and 8 general vision understanding benchmarks, our RynnBrain foundation models largely outperform existing embodied foundation models by a significant margin. The post-trained model suite further substantiates two key potentials of the RynnBrain foundation model: (i) enabling physically grounded reasoning and planning, and (ii) serving as a strong pretrained backbone that can be efficiently adapted to diverse embodied tasks.]]></description>

We introduce ResearchGym, a benchmark and execution environment for evaluating AI agents on end-to-end research. To instantiate this, we repurpose five oral and spotlight papers from ICML, ICLR, and ACL. From each paper's repository, we preserve the datasets, evaluation harness, and baseline implementations but withhold the paper's proposed method. This results in five containerized task environments comprising 39 sub-tasks in total. Within each environment, agents must propose novel hypotheses, run experiments, and attempt to surpass strong human baselines on the paper's metrics. In a controlled evaluation of an agent powered by GPT-5, we observe a sharp capability--reliability gap. The agent improves over the provided baselines from the repository in just 1 of 15 evaluations (6.7%) by 11.5%, and completes only 26.5% of sub-tasks on average. We identify recurring long-horizon failure modes, including impatience, poor time and resource management, overconfidence in weak hypotheses, difficulty coordinating parallel experiments, and hard limits from context length. Yet in a single run, the agent surpasses the solution of an ICML 2025 Spotlight task, indicating that frontier agents can occasionally reach state-of-the-art performance, but do so unreliably. We additionally evaluate proprietary agent scaffolds including Claude Code (Opus-4.5) and Codex (GPT-5.2) which display a similar gap. ResearchGym provides infrastructure for systematic evaluation and analysis of autonomous agents on closed-loop research.]]></description>

Training large language models (LLMs) relies almost exclusively on dense adaptive optimizers with increasingly sophisticated preconditioners. We challenge this by showing that randomly masking parameter updates can be highly effective, with a masked variant of RMSProp consistently outperforming recent state-of-the-art optimizers. Our analysis reveals that the random masking induces a curvature-dependent geometric regularization that smooths the optimization trajectory. Motivated by this finding, we introduce Momentum-aligned gradient masking (Magma), which modulates the masked updates using momentum-gradient alignment. Extensive LLM pre-training experiments show that Magma is a simple drop-in replacement for adaptive optimizers with consistent gains and negligible computational overhead. Notably, for the 1B model size, Magma reduces perplexity by over 19\% and 9\% compared to Adam and Muon, respectively.]]></description>

We introduce the Massive Audio Embedding Benchmark (MAEB), a large-scale benchmark covering 30 tasks across speech, music, environmental sounds, and cross-modal audio-text reasoning in 100+ languages. We evaluate 50+ models and find that no single model dominates across all tasks: contrastive audio-text models excel at environmental sound classification (e.g., ESC50) but score near random on multilingual speech tasks (e.g., SIB-FLEURS), while speech-pretrained models show the opposite pattern. Clustering remains challenging for all models, with even the best-performing model achieving only modest results. We observe that models excelling on acoustic understanding often perform poorly on linguistic tasks, and vice versa. We also show that the performance of audio encoders on MAEB correlates highly with their performance when used in audio large language models. MAEB is derived from MAEB+, a collection of 98 tasks. MAEB is designed to maintain task diversity while reducing evaluation cost, and it integrates into the MTEB ecosystem for unified evaluation across text, image, and audio modalities. We release MAEB and all 98 tasks along with code and a leaderboard at https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb.]]></description>

AI agents are increasingly deployed to execute important tasks. While rising accuracy scores on standard benchmarks suggest rapid progress, many agents still continue to fail in practice. This discrepancy highlights a fundamental limitation of current evaluations: compressing agent behavior into a single success metric obscures critical operational flaws. Notably, it ignores whether agents behave consistently across runs, withstand perturbations, fail predictably, or have bounded error severity. Grounded in safety-critical engineering, we provide a holistic performance profile by proposing twelve concrete metrics that decompose agent reliability along four key dimensions: consistency, robustness, predictability, and safety. Evaluating 14 agentic models across two complementary benchmarks, we find that recent capability gains have only yielded small improvements in reliability. By exposing these persistent limitations, our metrics complement traditional evaluations while offering tools for reasoning about how agents perform, degrade, and fail.]]></description>

For deploying foundation models, practitioners increasingly need prescriptive scaling laws: given a pre training compute budget, what downstream accuracy is attainable with contemporary post training practice, and how stable is that mapping as the field evolves? Using large scale observational evaluations with 5k observational and 2k newly sampled data on model performance, we estimate capability boundaries, high conditional quantiles of benchmark scores as a function of log pre training FLOPs, via smoothed quantile regression with a monotone, saturating sigmoid parameterization. We validate the temporal reliability by fitting on earlier model generations and evaluating on later releases. Across various tasks, the estimated boundaries are mostly stable, with the exception of math reasoning that exhibits a consistently advancing boundary over time. We then extend our approach to analyze task dependent saturation and to probe contamination related shifts on math reasoning tasks. Finally, we introduce an efficient algorithm that recovers near full data frontiers using roughly 20% of evaluation budget. Together, our work releases the Proteus 2k, the latest model performance evaluation dataset, and introduces a practical methodology for translating compute budgets into reliable performance expectations and for monitoring when capability boundaries shift across time.]]></description>

Large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle with knowledge-intensive questions that require up-to-date information and multi-hop reasoning. Augmenting LLMs with hybrid external knowledge, such as unstructured text and structured knowledge graphs, offers a promising alternative to costly continual pretraining. As such, reliable evaluation of their retrieval and reasoning capabilities becomes critical. However, many existing benchmarks increasingly overlap with LLM pretraining data, which means answers or supporting knowledge may already be encoded in model parameters, making it difficult to distinguish genuine retrieval and reasoning from parametric recall. We introduce HybridRAG-Bench, a framework for constructing benchmarks to evaluate retrieval-intensive, multi-hop reasoning over hybrid knowledge. HybridRAG-Bench automatically couples unstructured text and structured knowledge graph representations derived from recent scientific literature on arXiv, and generates knowledge-intensive question-answer pairs grounded in explicit reasoning paths. The framework supports flexible domain and time-frame selection, enabling contamination-aware and customizable evaluation as models and knowledge evolve. Experiments across three domains (artificial intelligence, governance and policy, and bioinformatics) demonstrate that HybridRAG-Bench rewards genuine retrieval and reasoning rather than parametric recall, offering a principled testbed for evaluating hybrid knowledge-augmented reasoning systems. We release our code and data at github.com/junhongmit/HybridRAG-Bench.]]></description>

Generative AI agents equate understanding with resolving explicit queries, an assumption that confines interaction to what users can articulate. This assumption breaks down when users themselves lack awareness of what is missing, risky, or worth considering. In such conditions, proactivity is not merely an efficiency enhancement, but an epistemic necessity. We refer to this condition as epistemic incompleteness: where progress depends on engaging with unknown unknowns for effective partnership. Existing approaches to proactivity remain narrowly anticipatory, extrapolating from past behavior and presuming that goals are already well defined, thereby failing to support users meaningfully. However, surfacing possibilities beyond a user's current awareness is not inherently beneficial. Unconstrained proactive interventions can misdirect attention, overwhelm users, or introduce harm. Proactive agents, therefore, require behavioral grounding: principled constraints on when, how, and to what extent an agent should intervene. We advance the position that generative proactivity must be grounded both epistemically and behaviorally. Drawing on the philosophy of ignorance and research on proactive behavior, we argue that these theories offer critical guidance for designing agents that can engage responsibly and foster meaningful partnerships.]]></description>

Visual loco-manipulation of arbitrary objects in the wild with humanoid robots requires accurate end-effector (EE) control and a generalizable understanding of the scene via visual inputs (e.g., RGB-D images). Existing approaches are based on real-world imitation learning and exhibit limited generalization due to the difficulty in collecting large-scale training datasets. This paper presents a new paradigm, HERO, for object loco-manipulation with humanoid robots that combines the strong generalization and open-vocabulary understanding of large vision models with strong control performance from simulated training. We achieve this by designing an accurate residual-aware EE tracking policy. This EE tracking policy combines classical robotics with machine learning. It uses a) inverse kinematics to convert residual end-effector targets into reference trajectories, b) a learned neural forward model for accurate forward kinematics, c) goal adjustment, and d) replanning. Together, these innovations help us cut down the end-effector tracking error by 3.2x. We use this accurate end-effector tracker to build a modular system for loco-manipulation, where we use open-vocabulary large vision models for strong visual generalization. Our system is able to operate in diverse real-world environments, from offices to coffee shops, where the robot is able to reliably manipulate various everyday objects (e.g., mugs, apples, toys) on surfaces ranging from 43cm to 92cm in height. Systematic modular and end-to-end tests in simulation and the real world demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed design. We believe the advances in this paper can open up new ways of training humanoid robots to interact with daily objects.]]></description>

Unified models can handle both multimodal understanding and generation within a single architecture, yet they typically operate in a single pass without iteratively refining their outputs. Many multimodal tasks, especially those involving complex spatial compositions, multiple interacting objects, or evolving instructions, require decomposing instructions, verifying intermediate results, and making iterative corrections. While test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated that allocating additional inference compute for iterative reasoning substantially improves language model performance, extending this paradigm to unified multimodal models remains an open challenge. We introduce UniT, a framework for multimodal chain-of-thought test-time scaling that enables a single unified model to reason, verify, and refine across multiple rounds. UniT combines agentic data synthesis, unified model training, and flexible test-time inference to elicit cognitive behaviors including verification, subgoal decomposition, and content memory. Our key findings are: (1) unified models trained on short reasoning trajectories generalize to longer inference chains at test time; (2) sequential chain-of-thought reasoning provides a more scalable and compute-efficient TTS strategy than parallel sampling; (3) training on generation and editing trajectories improves out-of-distribution visual reasoning. These results establish multimodal test-time scaling as an effective paradigm for advancing both generation and understanding in unified models.]]></description>

Text embedding models are widely used for semantic similarity tasks, including information retrieval, clustering, and classification. General-purpose models are typically trained with single- or multi-stage processes using contrastive loss functions. We introduce a novel training regimen that combines model distillation techniques with task-specific contrastive loss to produce compact, high-performance embedding models. Our findings suggest that this approach is more effective for training small models than purely contrastive or distillation-based training paradigms alone. Benchmark scores for the resulting models, jina-embeddings-v5-text-small and jina-embeddings-v5-text-nano, exceed or match the state-of-the-art for models of similar size. jina-embeddings-v5-text models additionally support long texts (up to 32k tokens) in many languages, and generate embeddings that remain robust under truncation and binary quantization. Model weights are publicly available, hopefully inspiring further advances in embedding model development.]]></description>

State-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models excel at semantic generalization but struggle to generalize to unseen physical motions in novel environments. We introduce DreamZero, a World Action Model (WAM) built upon a pretrained video diffusion backbone. Unlike VLAs, WAMs learn physical dynamics by predicting future world states and actions, using video as a dense representation of how the world evolves. By jointly modeling video and action, DreamZero learns diverse skills effectively from heterogeneous robot data without relying on repetitive demonstrations. This results in over 2x improvement in generalization to new tasks and environments compared to state-of-the-art VLAs in real robot experiments. Crucially, through model and system optimizations, we enable a 14B autoregressive video diffusion model to perform real-time closed-loop control at 7Hz. Finally, we demonstrate two forms of cross-embodiment transfer: video-only demonstrations from other robots or humans yield a relative improvement of over 42% on unseen task performance with just 10-20 minutes of data. More surprisingly, DreamZero enables few-shot embodiment adaptation, transferring to a new embodiment with only 30 minutes of play data while retaining zero-shot generalization.]]></description>

Current research in multimodal models faces a key challenge where enhancing generative capabilities often comes at the expense of understanding, and vice versa. We analyzed this trade-off and identify the primary cause might be the potential conflict between generation and understanding, which creates a competitive dynamic within the model. To address this, we propose the Reason-Reflect-Refine (R3) framework. This innovative algorithm re-frames the single-step generation task into a multi-step process of "generate-understand-regenerate". By explicitly leveraging the model's understanding capability during generation, we successfully mitigate the optimization dilemma, achieved stronger generation results and improved understanding ability which are related to the generation process. This offers valuable insights for designing next-generation unified multimodal models. Code is available at https://github.com/sen-ye/R3.]]></description>

Large Language Models (LLMs) are changing the coding paradigm, known as vibe coding, yet synthesizing algorithmically sophisticated and robust code still remains a critical challenge. Incentivizing the deep reasoning capabilities of LLMs is essential to overcoming this hurdle. Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as a promising strategy to address this need. However, most existing approaches overlook the heterogeneous difficulty and granularity inherent in test cases, leading to an imbalanced distribution of reward signals and consequently biased gradient updates during training. To address this, we propose Test-driven and cApability-adaptive cuRriculum reinfOrcement fine-Tuning (TAROT). TAROT systematically constructs, for each problem, a four-tier test suite (basic, intermediate, complex, edge), providing a controlled difficulty landscape for curriculum design and evaluation. Crucially, TAROT decouples curriculum progression from raw reward scores, enabling capability-conditioned evaluation and principled selection from a portfolio of curriculum policies rather than incidental test-case difficulty composition. This design fosters stable optimization and more efficient competency acquisition. Extensive experimental results reveal that the optimal curriculum for RFT in code generation is closely tied to a model's inherent capability, with less capable models achieving greater gains with an easy-to-hard progression, whereas more competent models excel under a hard-first curriculum. TAROT provides a reproducible method that adaptively tailors curriculum design to a model's capability, thereby consistently improving the functional correctness and robustness of the generated code. All code and data are released to foster reproducibility and advance community research at https://github.com/deep-diver/TAROT.]]></description>

Long-horizon multimodal agents depend on external memory; however, similarity-based retrieval often surfaces stale, low-credibility, or conflicting items, which can trigger overconfident errors. We propose Multimodal Memory Agent (MMA), which assigns each retrieved memory item a dynamic reliability score by combining source credibility, temporal decay, and conflict-aware network consensus, and uses this signal to reweight evidence and abstain when support is insufficient. We also introduce MMA-Bench, a programmatically generated benchmark for belief dynamics with controlled speaker reliability and structured text-vision contradictions. Using this framework, we uncover the "Visual Placebo Effect", revealing how RAG-based agents inherit latent visual biases from foundation models. On FEVER, MMA matches baseline accuracy while reducing variance by 35.2% and improving selective utility; on LoCoMo, a safety-oriented configuration improves actionable accuracy and reduces wrong answers; on MMA-Bench, MMA reaches 41.18% Type-B accuracy in Vision mode, while the baseline collapses to 0.0% under the same protocol.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has significantly improved large language model reasoning, but existing RL fine-tuning methods rely heavily on heuristic techniques such as entropy regularization and reweighting to maintain stability. In practice, they often experience late-stage performance collapse, leading to degraded reasoning quality and unstable training. We derive that the magnitude of token-wise policy gradients in RL is negatively correlated with token probability and local policy entropy. Building on this result, we prove that training instability is driven by a tiny fraction of tokens, approximately 0.01\%, which we term spurious tokens. When such tokens appear in correct responses, they contribute little to the reasoning outcome but inherit the full sequence-level reward, leading to abnormally amplified gradient updates. Motivated by this observation, we propose Spurious-Token-Aware Policy Optimization (STAPO) for large-scale model refining, which selectively masks such updates and renormalizes the loss over valid tokens. Across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks using Qwen 1.7B, 8B, and 14B base models, STAPO consistently demonstrates superior entropy stability and achieves an average performance improvement of 7.13\% over GRPO, 20-Entropy and JustRL.]]></description>

Generative large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently achieved impressive performance gains, and their user base is growing rapidly. However, the security of LVLMs, in particular in a long-context multi-turn setting, is largely underexplored. In this paper, we consider the realistic scenario in which an attacker uploads a manipulated image to the web/social media. A benign user downloads this image and uses it as input to the LVLM. Our novel stealthy Visual Memory Injection (VMI) attack is designed such that on normal prompts the LVLM exhibits nominal behavior, but once the user gives a triggering prompt, the LVLM outputs a specific prescribed target message to manipulate the user, e.g. for adversarial marketing or political persuasion. Compared to previous work that focused on single-turn attacks, VMI is effective even after a long multi-turn conversation with the user. We demonstrate our attack on several recent open-weight LVLMs. This article thereby shows that large-scale manipulation of users is feasible with perturbed images in multi-turn conversation settings, calling for better robustness of LVLMs against these attacks. We release the source code at https://github.com/chs20/visual-memory-injection]]></description>

Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models have unlocked advanced collaborative reasoning, yet they remain shackled by the inefficiency of discrete text communication, which imposes significant runtime overhead and information quantization loss. While latent state transfer offers a high-bandwidth alternative, existing approaches either assume homogeneous sender-receiver architectures or rely on pair-specific learned translators, limiting scalability and modularity across diverse model families with disjoint manifolds. In this work, we propose the Vision Wormhole, a novel framework that repurposes the visual interface of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable model-agnostic, text-free communication. By introducing a Universal Visual Codec, we map heterogeneous reasoning traces into a shared continuous latent space and inject them directly into the receiver's visual pathway, effectively treating the vision encoder as a universal port for inter-agent telepathy. Our framework adopts a hub-and-spoke topology to reduce pairwise alignment complexity from O(N^2) to O(N) and leverages a label-free, teacher-student distillation objective to align the high-speed visual channel with the robust reasoning patterns of the text pathway. Extensive experiments across heterogeneous model families (e.g., Qwen-VL, Gemma) demonstrate that the Vision Wormhole reduces end-to-end wall-clock time in controlled comparisons while maintaining reasoning fidelity comparable to standard text-based MAS.

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced embodied AI, and using them to benchmark robotic intelligence has become a pivotal trend. However, existing frameworks remain predominantly confined to single-arm manipulation, failing to capture the spatio-temporal coordination required for bimanual tasks like lifting a heavy pot. To address this, we introduce BiManiBench, a hierarchical benchmark evaluating MLLMs across three tiers: fundamental spatial reasoning, high-level action planning, and low-level end-effector control. Our framework isolates unique bimanual challenges, such as arm reachability and kinematic constraints, thereby distinguishing perceptual hallucinations from planning failures. Analysis of over 30 state-of-the-art models reveals that despite high-level reasoning proficiency, MLLMs struggle with dual-arm spatial grounding and control, frequently resulting in mutual interference and sequencing errors. These findings suggest the current paradigm lacks a deep understanding of mutual kinematic constraints, highlighting the need for future research to focus on inter-arm collision-avoidance and fine-grained temporal sequencing.]]></description>

High-fidelity generative video editing has seen significant quality improvements by leveraging pre-trained video foundation models. However, their computational cost is a major bottleneck, as they are often designed to inefficiently process the full video context regardless of the inpainting mask's size, even for sparse, localized edits. In this paper, we introduce EditCtrl, an efficient video inpainting control framework that focuses computation only where it is needed. Our approach features a novel local video context module that operates solely on masked tokens, yielding a computational cost proportional to the edit size. This local-first generation is then guided by a lightweight temporal global context embedder that ensures video-wide context consistency with minimal overhead. Not only is EditCtrl 10 times more compute efficient than state-of-the-art generative editing methods, it even improves editing quality compared to methods designed with full-attention. Finally, we showcase how EditCtrl unlocks new capabilities, including multi-region editing with text prompts and autoregressive content propagation.]]></description>

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a dominant paradigm for end-to-end autonomous driving (AD). However, RL suffers from sample inefficiency and a lack of semantic interpretability in complex scenarios. Foundation Models, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs), can mitigate this by offering rich, context-aware knowledge, yet their high inference latency hinders deployment in high-frequency RL training loops. To bridge this gap, we present Found-RL, a platform tailored to efficiently enhance RL for AD using foundation models. A core innovation is the asynchronous batch inference framework, which decouples heavy VLM reasoning from the simulation loop, effectively resolving latency bottlenecks to support real-time learning. We introduce diverse supervision mechanisms: Value-Margin Regularization (VMR) and Advantage-Weighted Action Guidance (AWAG) to effectively distill expert-like VLM action suggestions into the RL policy. Additionally, we adopt high-throughput CLIP for dense reward shaping. We address CLIP's dynamic blindness via Conditional Contrastive Action Alignment, which conditions prompts on discretized speed/command and yields a normalized, margin-based bonus from context-specific action-anchor scoring. Found-RL provides an end-to-end pipeline for fine-tuned VLM integration and shows that a lightweight RL model can achieve near-VLM performance compared with billion-parameter VLMs while sustaining real-time inference (approx. 500 FPS). Code, data, and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/ys-qu/found-rl.]]></description>

Standard factuality evaluations of LLMs treat all errors alike, obscuring whether failures arise from missing knowledge (empty shelves) or from limited access to encoded facts (lost keys). We propose a behavioral framework that profiles factual knowledge at the level of facts rather than questions, characterizing each fact by whether it is encoded, and then by how accessible it is: cannot be recalled, can be directly recalled, or can only be recalled with inference-time computation (thinking). To support such profiling, we introduce WikiProfile, a new benchmark constructed via an automated pipeline with a prompted LLM grounded in web search. Across 4 million responses from 13 LLMs, we find that encoding is nearly saturated in frontier models on our benchmark, with GPT-5 and Gemini-3 encoding 95--98% of facts. However, recall remains a major bottleneck: many errors previously attributed to missing knowledge instead stem from failures to access it. These failures are systematic and disproportionately affect long-tail facts and reverse questions. Finally, we show that thinking improves recall and can recover a substantial fraction of failures, indicating that future gains may rely less on scaling and more on methods that improve how models utilize what they already encode.]]></description>

Evaluating whether Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) genuinely reason about physical dynamics remains challenging. Most existing benchmarks rely on recognition-style protocols such as Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Violation of Expectation (VoE), which can often be answered without committing to an explicit, testable physical hypothesis. We propose VisPhyWorld, an execution-based framework that evaluates physical reasoning by requiring models to generate executable simulator code from visual observations. By producing runnable code, the inferred world representation is directly inspectable, editable, and falsifiable. This separates physical reasoning from rendering. Building on this framework, we introduce VisPhyBench, comprising 209 evaluation scenes derived from 108 physical templates and a systematic protocol that evaluates how well models reconstruct appearance and reproduce physically plausible motion. Our pipeline produces valid reconstructed videos in 97.7% on the benchmark. Experiments show that while state-of-the-art MLLMs achieve strong semantic scene understanding, they struggle to accurately infer physical parameters and to simulate consistent physical dynamics.]]></description>

The Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that representations from neural networks are converging to a common statistical model of reality. We show that the existing metrics used to measure representational similarity are confounded by network scale: increasing model depth or width can systematically inflate representational similarity scores. To correct these effects, we introduce a permutation-based null-calibration framework that transforms any representational similarity metric into a calibrated score with statistical guarantees. We revisit the Platonic Representation Hypothesis with our calibration framework, which reveals a nuanced picture: the apparent convergence reported by global spectral measures largely disappears after calibration, while local neighborhood similarity, but not local distances, retains significant agreement across different modalities. Based on these findings, we propose the Aristotelian Representation Hypothesis: representations in neural networks are converging to shared local neighborhood relationships.]]></description>

We introduce SAM 3D Body (3DB), a promptable model for single-image full-body 3D human mesh recovery (HMR) that demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with strong generalization and consistent accuracy in diverse in-the-wild conditions. 3DB estimates the human pose of the body, feet, and hands. It is the first model to use a new parametric mesh representation, Momentum Human Rig (MHR), which decouples skeletal structure and surface shape. 3DB employs an encoder-decoder architecture and supports auxiliary prompts, including 2D keypoints and masks, enabling user-guided inference similar to the SAM family of models. We derive high-quality annotations from a multi-stage annotation pipeline that uses various combinations of manual keypoint annotation, differentiable optimization, multi-view geometry, and dense keypoint detection. Our data engine efficiently selects and processes data to ensure data diversity, collecting unusual poses and rare imaging conditions. We present a new evaluation dataset organized by pose and appearance categories, enabling nuanced analysis of model behavior. Our experiments demonstrate superior generalization and substantial improvements over prior methods in both qualitative user preference studies and traditional quantitative analysis. Both 3DB and MHR are open-source.]]></description>

Achieving cooperation among self-interested agents remains a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Recent work showed that mutual cooperation can be induced between "learning-aware" agents that account for and shape the learning dynamics of their co-players. However, existing approaches typically rely on hardcoded, often inconsistent, assumptions about co-player learning rules or enforce a strict separation between "naive learners" updating on fast timescales and "meta-learners" observing these updates. Here, we demonstrate that the in-context learning capabilities of sequence models allow for co-player learning awareness without requiring hardcoded assumptions or explicit timescale separation. We show that training sequence model agents against a diverse distribution of co-players naturally induces in-context best-response strategies, effectively functioning as learning algorithms on the fast intra-episode timescale. We find that the cooperative mechanism identified in prior work-where vulnerability to extortion drives mutual shaping-emerges naturally in this setting: in-context adaptation renders agents vulnerable to extortion, and the resulting mutual pressure to shape the opponent's in-context learning dynamics resolves into the learning of cooperative behavior. Our results suggest that standard decentralized reinforcement learning on sequence models combined with co-player diversity provides a scalable path to learning cooperative behaviors.]]></description>

Post-training compression of Transformer models commonly relies on truncated singular value decomposition (SVD). However, enforcing a single shared subspace can degrade accuracy even at moderate compression. Sparse dictionary learning provides a more flexible union-of-subspaces representation, but existing approaches often suffer from iterative dictionary and coefficient updates. We propose COMPOT (Calibration-Optimized Matrix Procrustes Orthogonalization for Transformers), a training-free compression framework that uses a small calibration dataset to estimate a sparse weight factorization. COMPOT employs orthogonal dictionaries that enable closed-form Procrustes updates for the dictionary and analytical single-step sparse coding for the coefficients, eliminating iterative optimization. To handle heterogeneous layer sensitivity under a global compression budget, COMPOT further introduces a one-shot dynamic allocation strategy that adaptively redistributes layer-wise compression rates. Extensive experiments across diverse architectures and tasks show that COMPOT consistently delivers a superior quality-compression trade-off over strong low-rank and sparse baselines, while remaining fully compatible with post-training quantization for extreme compression. Code is available https://github.com/mts-ai/COMPOT{here}.]]></description>

Language models are increasingly used to reason over content they were not trained on, such as new documents, evolving knowledge, and user-specific data. A common approach is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which stores verbatim documents externally (as chunks) and retrieves only a relevant subset at inference time for an LLM to reason over. However, this results in inefficient usage of test-time compute (LLM repeatedly reasons over the same documents); moreover, chunk retrieval can inject irrelevant context that increases unsupported generation. We propose a human-like non-parametric continual learning framework, where the base model remains fixed, and learning occurs by integrating each new experience into an external semantic memory state that accumulates and consolidates itself continually. We present Panini, which realizes this by representing documents as Generative Semantic Workspaces (GSW) -- an entity- and event-aware network of question-answer (QA) pairs, sufficient for an LLM to reconstruct the experienced situations and mine latent knowledge via reasoning-grounded inference chains on the network. Given a query, Panini only traverses the continually-updated GSW (not the verbatim documents or chunks), and retrieves the most likely inference chains. Across six QA benchmarks, Panini achieves the highest average performance, 5%-7% higher than other competitive baselines, while using 2-30x fewer answer-context tokens, supports fully open-source pipelines, and reduces unsupported answers on curated unanswerable queries. The results show that efficient and accurate structuring of experiences at write time -- as achieved by the GSW framework -- yields both efficiency and reliability gains at read time. Code is available at https://github.com/roychowdhuryresearch/gsw-memory.]]></description>

World models require robust relational understanding to support prediction, reasoning, and control. While object-centric representations provide a useful abstraction, they are not sufficient to capture interaction-dependent dynamics. We therefore propose C-JEPA, a simple and flexible object-centric world model that extends masked joint embedding prediction from image patches to object-centric representations. By applying object-level masking that requires an object's state to be inferred from other objects, C-JEPA induces latent interventions with counterfactual-like effects and prevents shortcut solutions, making interaction reasoning essential. Empirically, C-JEPA leads to consistent gains in visual question answering, with an absolute improvement of about 20\% in counterfactual reasoning compared to the same architecture without object-level masking. On agent control tasks, C-JEPA enables substantially more efficient planning by using only 1\% of the total latent input features required by patch-based world models, while achieving comparable performance. Finally, we provide a formal analysis demonstrating that object-level masking induces a causal inductive bias via latent interventions. Our code is available at https://github.com/galilai-group/cjepa.]]></description>

A core aspect of human perception is situated awareness, the ability to relate ourselves to the surrounding physical environment and reason over possible actions in context. However, most existing benchmarks for multimodal foundation models (MFMs) emphasize environment-centric spatial relations (relations among objects in a scene), while largely overlooking observer-centric relationships that require reasoning relative to agent's viewpoint, pose, and motion. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAW-Bench (Situated Awareness in the Real World), a novel benchmark for evaluating egocentric situated awareness using real-world videos. SAW-Bench comprises 786 self-recorded videos captured with Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses spanning diverse indoor and outdoor environments, and over 2,071 human-annotated question-answer pairs. It probes a model's observer-centric understanding with six different awareness tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model performance gap of 37.66%, even with the best-performing MFM, Gemini 3 Flash. Beyond this gap, our in-depth analysis uncovers several notable findings; for example, while models can exploit partial geometric cues in egocentric videos, they often fail to infer a coherent camera geometry, leading to systematic spatial reasoning errors. We position SAW-Bench as a benchmark for situated spatial intelligence, moving beyond passive observation to understanding physically grounded, observer-centric dynamics.]]></description>

The web is littered with images, once created for human consumption and now increasingly interpreted by agents using vision-language models (VLMs). These agents make visual decisions at scale, deciding what to click, recommend, or buy. Yet, we know little about the structure of their visual preferences. We introduce a framework for studying this by placing VLMs in controlled image-based choice tasks and systematically perturbing their inputs. Our key idea is to treat the agent's decision function as a latent visual utility that can be inferred through revealed preference: choices between systematically edited images. Starting from common images, such as product photos, we propose methods for visual prompt optimization, adapting text optimization methods to iteratively propose and apply visually plausible modifications using an image generation model (such as in composition, lighting, or background). We then evaluate which edits increase selection probability. Through large-scale experiments on frontier VLMs, we demonstrate that optimized edits significantly shift choice probabilities in head-to-head comparisons. We develop an automatic interpretability pipeline to explain these preferences, identifying consistent visual themes that drive selection. We argue that this approach offers a practical and efficient way to surface visual vulnerabilities, safety concerns that might otherwise be discovered implicitly in the wild, supporting more proactive auditing and governance of image-based AI agents.]]></description>

Maintaining spatial world consistency over long horizons remains a central challenge for camera-controllable video generation. Existing memory-based approaches often condition generation on globally reconstructed 3D scenes by rendering anchor videos from the reconstructed geometry in the history. However, reconstructing a global 3D scene from multiple views inevitably introduces cross-view misalignment, as pose and depth estimation errors cause the same surfaces to be reconstructed at slightly different 3D locations across views. When fused, these inconsistencies accumulate into noisy geometry that contaminates the conditioning signals and degrades generation quality. We introduce AnchorWeave, a memory-augmented video generation framework that replaces a single misaligned global memory with multiple clean local geometric memories and learns to reconcile their cross-view inconsistencies. To this end, AnchorWeave performs coverage-driven local memory retrieval aligned with the target trajectory and integrates the selected local memories through a multi-anchor weaving controller during generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchorWeave significantly improves long-term scene consistency while maintaining strong visual quality, with ablation and analysis studies further validating the effectiveness of local geometric conditioning, multi-anchor control, and coverage-driven retrieval.]]></description>

Computer-Aided Design (CAD) delivers rapid, editable modeling for engineering and manufacturing. Recent AI progress now makes full automation feasible for various CAD tasks. However, progress is bottlenecked by data: public corpora mostly contain sketch-extrude sequences, lack complex operations, multi-operation composition and design intent, and thus hinder effective fine-tuning. Attempts to bypass this with frozen VLMs often yield simple or invalid programs due to limited 3D grounding in current foundation models. We present CADEvolve, an evolution-based pipeline and dataset that starts from simple primitives and, via VLM-guided edits and validations, incrementally grows CAD programs toward industrial-grade complexity. The result is 8k complex parts expressed as executable CadQuery parametric generators. After multi-stage post-processing and augmentation, we obtain a unified dataset of 1.3m scripts paired with rendered geometry and exercising the full CadQuery operation set. A VLM fine-tuned on CADEvolve achieves state-of-the-art results on the Image2CAD task across the DeepCAD, Fusion 360, and MCB benchmarks.]]></description>

Predictive world models that simulate future observations under explicit camera control are fundamental to interactive AI. Despite rapid advances, current systems lack spatial persistence: they fail to maintain stable scene structures over long trajectories, frequently hallucinating details when cameras revisit previously observed locations. We identify that this geometric drift stems from reliance on screen-space positional embeddings, which conflict with the projective geometry required for 3D consistency. We introduce ViewRope, a geometry-aware encoding that injects camera-ray directions directly into video transformer self-attention layers. By parameterizing attention with relative ray geometry rather than pixel locality, ViewRope provides a model-native inductive bias for retrieving 3D-consistent content across temporal gaps. We further propose Geometry-Aware Frame-Sparse Attention, which exploits these geometric cues to selectively attend to relevant historical frames, improving efficiency without sacrificing memory consistency. We also present ViewBench, a diagnostic suite measuring loop-closure fidelity and geometric drift. Our results demonstrate that ViewRope substantially improves long-term consistency while reducing computational costs.]]></description>

We introduce LM-Lexicon, an innovative definition modeling approach that incorporates data clustering, semantic expert learning, and model merging using a sparse mixture-of-experts architecture. By decomposing the definition modeling task into specialized semantic domains, where small language models are trained as domain experts, LM-Lexicon achieves substantial improvements (+7% BLEU score compared with the prior state-of-the-art model) over existing methods on five widely used benchmarks. Empirically, we demonstrate that 1) the clustering strategy enables fine-grained expert specialization with nearly 10% improvement in definition quality; 2) the semantic-aware domain-level routing mechanism achieves higher expert efficacy (+1%) than conventional token-level routing; and 3) further performance gains can be obtained through test-time compute and semantic expert scaling. Our work advances definition modeling while providing insights into the development of efficient language models for semantic-intensive applications.]]></description>

Efficient long-context processing remains a crucial challenge for contemporary large language models (LLMs), especially in resource-constrained environments. Soft compression architectures promise to extend effective context length by replacing long token sequences with smaller sets of learned compressed tokens. Yet, the limits of compressibility -- and when compression begins to erase task-relevant content -- remain underexplored. In this paper, we define token overflow as a regime in which compressed representations no longer contain sufficient information to answer a given query, and propose a methodology to characterize and detect it. In the xRAG soft-compression setting, we find that query-agnostic saturation statistics reliably separate compressed from uncompressed token representations, providing a practical tool for identifying compressed tokens but showing limited overflow detection capability. Lightweight probing classifiers over both query and context xRAG representations detect overflow with 0.72 AUC-ROC on average on HotpotQA, SQuADv2, and TriviaQA datasets, demonstrating that incorporating query information improves detection performance. These results advance from query-independent diagnostics to query-aware detectors, enabling low-cost pre-LLM gating to mitigate compression-induced errors.]]></description>

Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising tool for interpreting neural networks by decomposing their activations into sparse sets of human-interpretable features. Recent work has introduced multiple SAE variants and successfully scaled them to frontier models. Despite much excitement, a growing number of negative results in downstream tasks casts doubt on whether SAEs recover meaningful features. To directly investigate this, we perform two complementary evaluations. On a synthetic setup with known ground-truth features, we demonstrate that SAEs recover only 9% of true features despite achieving 71% explained variance, showing that they fail at their core task even when reconstruction is strong. To evaluate SAEs on real activations, we introduce three baselines that constrain SAE feature directions or their activation patterns to random values. Through extensive experiments across multiple SAE architectures, we show that our baselines match fully-trained SAEs in interpretability (0.87 vs 0.90), sparse probing (0.69 vs 0.72), and causal editing (0.73 vs 0.72). Together, these results suggest that SAEs in their current state do not reliably decompose models' internal mechanisms.]]></description>

Sparse-Linear Attention (SLA) combines sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion models and has shown strong performance in video generation. However, (i) SLA relies on a heuristic split that assigns computations to the sparse or linear branch based on attention-weight magnitude, which can be suboptimal. Additionally, (ii) after formally analyzing the attention error in SLA, we identify a mismatch between SLA and a direct decomposition into sparse and linear attention. We propose SLA2, which introduces (I) a learnable router that dynamically selects whether each attention computation should use sparse or linear attention, (II) a more faithful and direct sparse-linear attention formulation that uses a learnable ratio to combine the sparse and linear attention branches, and (III) a sparse + low-bit attention design, where low-bit attention is introduced via quantization-aware fine-tuning to reduce quantization error. Experiments show that on video diffusion models, SLA2 can achieve 97% attention sparsity and deliver an 18.6x attention speedup while preserving generation quality.]]></description>

Inference-Time-Compute (ITC) methods like Best-of-N and Tree-of-Thoughts are meant to produce output candidates that are both high-quality and diverse, but their use of high-temperature sampling often fails to achieve meaningful output diversity. Moreover, existing ITC methods offer limited control over how to perform reasoning, which in turn limits their explainability. We present STATe-of-Thoughts (STATe), an interpretable ITC method that searches over high-level reasoning patterns. STATe replaces stochastic sampling with discrete and interpretable textual interventions: a controller selects actions encoding high-level reasoning choices, a generator produces reasoning steps conditioned on those choices, and an evaluator scores candidates to guide search. This structured approach yields three main advantages. First, action-guided textual interventions produce greater response diversity than temperature-based sampling. Second, in a case study on argument generation, STATe's explicit action sequences capture interpretable features that are highly predictive of output quality. Third, estimating the association between performance and action choices allows us to identify promising yet unexplored regions of the action space and steer generation directly toward them. Together, these results establish STATe as a practical framework for generating high-quality, diverse, and interpretable text. Our framework is available at https://github.com/zbambergerNLP/state-of-thoughts.]]></description>

Clawdbot is a self-hosted, tool-using personal AI agent with a broad action space spanning local execution and web-mediated workflows, which raises heightened safety and security concerns under ambiguity and adversarial steering. We present a trajectory-centric evaluation of Clawdbot across six risk dimensions. Our test suite samples and lightly adapts scenarios from prior agent-safety benchmarks (including ATBench and LPS-Bench) and supplements them with hand-designed cases tailored to Clawdbot's tool surface. We log complete interaction trajectories (messages, actions, tool-call arguments/outputs) and assess safety using both an automated trajectory judge (AgentDoG-Qwen3-4B) and human review. Across 34 canonical cases, we find a non-uniform safety profile: performance is generally consistent on reliability-focused tasks, while most failures arise under underspecified intent, open-ended goals, or benign-seeming jailbreak prompts, where minor misinterpretations can escalate into higher-impact tool actions. We supplemented the overall results with representative case studies and summarized the commonalities of these cases, analyzing the security vulnerabilities and typical failure modes that Clawdbot is prone to trigger in practice.]]></description>

Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) is a powerful acceleration paradigm, yet its stability is often compromised in Forbidden Zone, regions where the real teacher provides unreliable guidance while the fake teacher exerts insufficient repulsive force. In this work, we propose a unified optimization framework that reinterprets prior art as implicit strategies to avoid these corrupted regions. Based on this insight, we introduce Adaptive Matching Distillation (AMD), a self-correcting mechanism that utilizes reward proxies to explicitly detect and escape Forbidden Zones. AMD dynamically prioritizes corrective gradients via structural signal decomposition and introduces Repulsive Landscape Sharpening to enforce steep energy barriers against failure mode collapse. Extensive experiments across image and video generation tasks (e.g., SDXL, Wan2.1) and rigorous benchmarks (e.g., VBench, GenEval) demonstrate that AMD significantly enhances sample fidelity and training robustness. For instance, AMD improves the HPSv2 score on SDXL from 30.64 to 31.25, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These findings validate that explicitly rectifying optimization trajectories within Forbidden Zones is essential for pushing the performance ceiling of few-step generative models.]]></description>

Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) has become a widely used benchmark for evaluating frontier large language models on challenging, multi-domain questions. However, community-led analyses have raised concerns that HLE contains a non-trivial number of noisy items, which can bias evaluation results and distort cross-model comparisons. To address this challenge, we introduce HLE-Verified, a verified and revised version of HLE with a transparent verification protocol and fine-grained error taxonomy. Our construction follows a two-stage validation-and-repair workflow resulting in a certified benchmark. In Stage I, each item undergoes binary validation of the problem and final answer through domain-expert review and model-based cross-checks, yielding 641 verified items. In Stage II, flawed but fixable items are revised under strict constraints preserving the original evaluation intent, through dual independent expert repairs, model-assisted auditing, and final adjudication, resulting in 1,170 revised-and-certified items. The remaining 689 items are released as a documented uncertain set with explicit uncertainty sources and expertise tags for future refinement. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art language models on HLE and HLE-Verified, observing an average absolute accuracy gain of 7--10 percentage points on HLE-Verified. The improvement is particularly pronounced on items where the original problem statement and/or reference answer is erroneous, with gains of 30--40 percentage points. Our analyses further reveal a strong association between model confidence and the presence of errors in the problem statement or reference answer, supporting the effectiveness of our revisions. Overall, HLE-Verified improves HLE-style evaluations by reducing annotation noise and enabling more faithful measurement of model capabilities.

Action chunking enables Vision Language Action (VLA) models to run in real time, but naive chunked execution often exhibits discontinuities at chunk boundaries. Real-Time Chunking (RTC) alleviates this issue but is external to the policy, leading to spurious multimodal switching and trajectories that are not intrinsically smooth. We propose Legato, a training-time continuation method for action-chunked flow-based VLA policies. Specifically, Legato initializes denoising from a schedule-shaped mixture of known actions and noise, exposing the model to partial action information. Moreover, Legato reshapes the learned flow dynamics to ensure that the denoising process remains consistent between training and inference under per-step guidance. Legato further uses randomized schedule condition during training to support varying inference delays and achieve controllable smoothness. Empirically, Legato produces smoother trajectories and reduces spurious multimodal switching during execution, leading to less hesitation and shorter task completion time. Extensive real-world experiments show that Legato consistently outperforms RTC across five manipulation tasks, achieving approximately 10% improvements in both trajectory smoothness and task completion time.]]></description>

Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate expert-level medical knowledge, aligning their open-ended outputs with fine-grained clinician preferences remains challenging. Existing methods often rely on coarse objectives or unreliable automated judges that are weakly grounded in professional guidelines. We propose a two-stage framework to address this gap. First, we introduce HealthRubrics, a dataset of 7,034 physician-verified preference examples in which clinicians refine LLM-drafted rubrics to meet rigorous medical standards. Second, we distill these rubrics into HealthPrinciples: 119 broadly reusable, clinically grounded principles organized by clinical dimensions, enabling scalable supervision beyond manual annotation. We use HealthPrinciples for (1) offline alignment by synthesizing rubrics for unlabeled queries and (2) an inference-time tool for guided self-revision. A 30B parameter model that activates only 3B parameters at inference trained with our framework achieves 33.4% on HealthBench-Hard, outperforming much larger models including Deepseek-R1 and o3, establishing a resource-efficient baseline for clinical alignment.]]></description>

Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) enables atlas-scale profiling of complex tissues, revealing rare lineages and transient states. Yet, assigning biologically valid cell identities remains a bottleneck because markers are tissue- and state-dependent, and novel states lack references. We present CellMaster, an AI agent that mimics expert practice for zero-shot cell-type annotation. Unlike existing automated tools, CellMaster leverages LLM-encoded knowledge (e.g., GPT-4o) to perform on-the-fly annotation with interpretable rationales, without pre-training or fixed marker databases. Across 9 datasets spanning 8 tissues, CellMaster improved accuracy by 7.1% over best-performing baselines (including CellTypist and scTab) in automatic mode. With human-in-the-loop refinement, this advantage increased to 18.6%, with a 22.1% gain on subtype populations. The system demonstrates particular strength in rare and novel cell states where baselines often fail.

As large language model agents increasingly populate networked environments, a fundamental question arises: do artificial intelligence (AI) agent societies undergo convergence dynamics similar to human social systems? Lately, Moltbook approximates a plausible future scenario in which autonomous agents participate in an open-ended, continuously evolving online society. We present the first large-scale systemic diagnosis of this AI agent society. Beyond static observation, we introduce a quantitative diagnostic framework for dynamic evolution in AI agent societies, measuring semantic stabilization, lexical turnover, individual inertia, influence persistence, and collective consensus. Our analysis reveals a system in dynamic balance in Moltbook: while global semantic averages stabilize rapidly, individual agents retain high diversity and persistent lexical turnover, defying homogenization. However, agents exhibit strong individual inertia and minimal adaptive response to interaction partners, preventing mutual influence and consensus. Consequently, influence remains transient with no persistent supernodes, and the society fails to develop stable collective influence anchors due to the absence of shared social memory. These findings demonstrate that scale and interaction density alone are insufficient to induce socialization, providing actionable design and analysis principles for upcoming next-generation AI agent societies.]]></description>

Configuring LLM-based agent systems involves choosing workflows, tools, token budgets, and prompts from a large combinatorial design space, and is typically handled today by fixed large templates or hand-tuned heuristics. This leads to brittle behavior and unnecessary compute, since the same cumbersome configuration is often applied to both easy and hard input queries. We formulate agent configuration as a query-wise decision problem and introduce ARC (Agentic Resource & Configuration learner), which learns a light-weight hierarchical policy using reinforcement learning to dynamically tailor these configurations. Across multiple benchmarks spanning reasoning and tool-augmented question answering, the learned policy consistently outperforms strong hand-designed and other baselines, achieving up to 25% higher task accuracy while also reducing token and runtime costs. These results demonstrate that learning per-query agent configurations is a powerful alternative to "one size fits all" designs.]]></description>

Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently demonstrated impressive performance for video compression. However, since a separate INR must be overfit for each video, scaling to high-resolution videos while maintaining encoding efficiency remains a significant challenge. Hypernetwork-based approaches predict INR weights (hyponetworks) for unseen videos at high speeds, but with low quality, large compressed size, and prohibitive memory needs at higher resolutions. We address these fundamental limitations through three key contributions: (1) an approach that decomposes the weight prediction task spatially and temporally, by breaking short video segments into patch tubelets, to reduce the pretraining memory overhead by 20$\times$; (2) a residual-based storage scheme that captures only differences between consecutive segment representations, significantly reducing bitstream size; and (3) a temporal coherence regularization framework that encourages changes in the weight space to be correlated with video content. Our proposed method, TeCoNeRV, achieves substantial improvements of 2.47dB and 5.35dB PSNR over the baseline at 480p and 720p on UVG, with 36% lower bitrates and 1.5-3$\times$ faster encoding speeds. With our low memory usage, we are the first hypernetwork approach to demonstrate results at 480p, 720p and 1080p on UVG, HEVC and MCL-JCV.

Latent space models are widely used for analyzing high-dimensional discrete data matrices, such as patient-feature matrices in electronic health records (EHRs), by capturing complex dependence structures through low-dimensional embeddings. However, estimation becomes challenging in the imbalanced regime, where one matrix dimension is much larger than the other. In EHR applications, cohort sizes are often limited by disease prevalence or data availability, whereas the feature space remains extremely large due to the breadth of medical coding system. Motivated by the increasing availability of external semantic embeddings, such as pre-trained embeddings of clinical concepts in EHRs, we propose a knowledge-embedded latent projection model that leverages semantic side information to regularize representation learning. Specifically, we model column embeddings as smooth functions of semantic embeddings via a mapping in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We develop a computationally efficient two-step estimation procedure that combines semantically guided subspace construction via kernel principal component analysis with scalable projected gradient descent. We establish estimation error bounds that characterize the trade-off between statistical error and approximation error induced by the kernel projection. Furthermore, we provide local convergence guarantees for our non-convex optimization procedure. Extensive simulation studies and a real-world EHR application demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.]]></description>

LLM-based agents are increasingly being deployed in contexts requiring complex authorization policies: customer service protocols, approval workflows, data access restrictions, and regulatory compliance. Embedding these policies in prompts provides no enforcement guarantees. We present PCAS, a Policy Compiler for Agentic Systems that provides deterministic policy enforcement.
  Enforcing such policies requires tracking information flow across agents, which linear message histories cannot capture. Instead, PCAS models the agentic system state as a dependency graph capturing causal relationships among events such as tool calls, tool results, and messages. Policies are expressed in a Datalog-derived language, as declarative rules that account for transitive information flow and cross-agent provenance. A reference monitor intercepts all actions and blocks violations before execution, providing deterministic enforcement independent of model reasoning.
  PCAS takes an existing agent implementation and a policy specification, and compiles them into an instrumented system that is policy-compliant by construction, with no security-specific restructuring required. We evaluate PCAS on three case studies: information flow policies for prompt injection defense, approval workflows in a multi-agent pharmacovigilance system, and organizational policies for customer service. On customer service tasks, PCAS improves policy compliance from 48% to 93% across frontier models, with zero policy violations in instrumented runs.]]></description>

Fast weight architectures offer a promising alternative to attention-based transformers for long-context modeling by maintaining constant memory overhead regardless of context length. However, their potential is limited by the next-token prediction (NTP) training paradigm. NTP optimizes single-token predictions and ignores semantic coherence across multiple tokens following a prefix. Consequently, fast weight models, which dynamically update their parameters to store contextual information, learn suboptimal representations that fail to capture long-range dependencies. We introduce REFINE (Reinforced Fast weIghts with Next sEquence prediction), a reinforcement learning framework that trains fast weight models under the next-sequence prediction (NSP) objective. REFINE selects informative token positions based on prediction entropy, generates multi-token rollouts, assigns self-supervised sequence-level rewards, and optimizes the model with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). REFINE is applicable throughout the training lifecycle of pre-trained language models: mid-training, post-training, and test-time training. Our experiments on LaCT-760M and DeltaNet-1.3B demonstrate that REFINE consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning with NTP across needle-in-a-haystack retrieval, long-context question answering, and diverse tasks in LongBench. REFINE provides an effective and versatile framework for improving long-context modeling in fast weight architectures.]]></description>

Large language models (LLMs) perform strongly on biological benchmarks, raising concerns that they may help novice actors acquire dual-use laboratory skills. Yet, whether this translates to improved human performance in the physical laboratory remains unclear. To address this, we conducted a pre-registered, investigator-blinded, randomized controlled trial (June-August 2025; n = 153) evaluating whether LLMs improve novice performance in tasks that collectively model a viral reverse genetics workflow. We observed no significant difference in the primary endpoint of workflow completion (5.2% LLM vs. 6.6% Internet; P = 0.759), nor in the success rate of individual tasks. However, the LLM arm had numerically higher success rates in four of the five tasks, most notably for the cell culture task (68.8% LLM vs. 55.3% Internet; P = 0.059). Post-hoc Bayesian modeling of pooled data estimates an approximate 1.4-fold increase (95% CrI 0.74-2.62) in success for a "typical" reverse genetics task under LLM assistance. Ordinal regression modelling suggests that participants in the LLM arm were more likely to progress through intermediate steps across all tasks (posterior probability of a positive effect: 81%-96%). Overall, mid-2025 LLMs did not substantially increase novice completion of complex laboratory procedures but were associated with a modest performance benefit. These results reveal a gap between in silico benchmarks and real-world utility, underscoring the need for physical-world validation of AI biosecurity assessments as model capabilities and user proficiency evolve.]]></description>

Vision-language models (VLMs) aim to reason by jointly leveraging visual and textual modalities. While allocating additional inference-time computation has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), achieving similar scaling in VLMs remains challenging. A key obstacle is that visual inputs are typically provided only once at the start of generation, while textual reasoning (e.g., early visual summaries) is generated autoregressively, causing reasoning to become increasingly text-dominated and allowing early visual grounding errors to accumulate. Moreover, vanilla guidance for visual grounding during inference is often coarse and noisy, making it difficult to steer reasoning over long texts. To address these challenges, we propose \emph{Saliency-Aware Principle} (SAP) selection. SAP operates on high-level reasoning principles rather than token-level trajectories, which enable stable control over discrete generation under noisy feedback while allowing later reasoning steps to re-consult visual evidence when renewed grounding is required. In addition, SAP supports multi-route inference, enabling parallel exploration of diverse reasoning behaviors. SAP is model-agnostic and data-free, requiring no additional training. Empirical results show that SAP achieves competitive performance, especially in reducing object hallucination, under comparable token-generation budgets while yielding more stable reasoning and lower response latency than CoT-style long sequential reasoning.]]></description>

LLMs are increasingly being used for complex problems which are not necessarily resolved in a single response, but require interacting with an environment to acquire information. In these scenarios, LLMs must reason about inherent cost-uncertainty tradeoffs in when to stop exploring and commit to an answer. For instance, on a programming task, an LLM should test a generated code snippet if it is uncertain about the correctness of that code; the cost of writing a test is nonzero, but typically lower than the cost of making a mistake. In this work, we show that we can induce LLMs to explicitly reason about balancing these cost-uncertainty tradeoffs, then perform more optimal environment exploration. We formalize multiple tasks, including information retrieval and coding, as sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. Each problem has latent environment state that can be reasoned about via a prior which is passed to the LLM agent. We introduce a framework called Calibrate-Then-Act (CTA), where we feed the LLM this additional context to enable it to act more optimally. This improvement is preserved even under RL training of both the baseline and CTA. Our results on information-seeking QA and on a simplified coding task show that making cost-benefit tradeoffs explicit with CTA can help agents discover more optimal decision-making strategies.]]></description>

Interpretability research on large language models (LLMs) has yielded important insights into model behaviour, yet recurring pitfalls persist: findings that do not generalise, and causal interpretations that outrun the evidence. Our position is that causal inference specifies what constitutes a valid mapping from model activations to invariant high-level structures, the data or assumptions needed to achieve it, and the inferences it can support. Specifically, Pearl's causal hierarchy clarifies what an interpretability study can justify. Observations establish associations between model behaviour and internal components. Interventions (e.g., ablations or activation patching) support claims how these edits affect a behavioural metric (\eg, average change in token probabilities) over a set of prompts. However, counterfactual claims -- i.e., asking what the model output would have been for the same prompt under an unobserved intervention -- remain largely unverifiable without controlled supervision. We show how causal representation learning (CRL) operationalises this hierarchy, specifying which variables are recoverable from activations and under what assumptions. Together, these motivate a diagnostic framework that helps practitioners select methods and evaluations matching claims to evidence such that findings generalise.]]></description>

Machine unlearning aims to remove specific data points from a trained model, often striving to emulate "perfect retraining", i.e., producing the model that would have been obtained had the deleted data never been included. We demonstrate that this approach, and security definitions that enable it, carry significant privacy risks for the remaining (undeleted) data points. We present a reconstruction attack showing that for certain tasks, which can be computed securely without deletions, a mechanism adhering to perfect retraining allows an adversary controlling merely $ω(1)$ data points to reconstruct almost the entire dataset merely by issuing deletion requests. We survey existing definitions for machine unlearning, showing they are either susceptible to such attacks or too restrictive to support basic functionalities like exact summation. To address this problem, we propose a new security definition that specifically safeguards undeleted data against leakage caused by the deletion of other points. We show that our definition permits several essential functionalities, such as bulletin boards, summations, and statistical learning.]]></description>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data exhibit strong and reproducible statistical structure. This has motivated the development of large-scale foundation models, such as TranscriptFormer, that use transformer-based architectures to learn a generative model for gene expression by embedding genes into a latent vector space. These embeddings have been used to obtain state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on downstream tasks such as cell-type classification, disease-state prediction, and cross-species learning. Here, we ask whether similar performance can be achieved without utilizing computationally intensive deep learning-based representations. Using simple, interpretable pipelines that rely on careful normalization and linear methods, we obtain SOTA or near SOTA performance across multiple benchmarks commonly used to evaluate single-cell foundation models, including outperforming foundation models on out-of-distribution tasks involving novel cell types and organisms absent from the training data. Our findings highlight the need for rigorous benchmarking and suggest that the biology of cell identity can be captured by simple linear representations of single cell gene expression data.]]></description>

Multiple hypothesis testing with false discovery rate (FDR) control is a fundamental problem in statistical inference, with broad applications in genomics, drug screening, and outlier detection. In many such settings, researchers may have access not only to real experimental observations but also to auxiliary or synthetic data -- from past, related experiments or generated by generative models -- that can provide additional evidence about the hypotheses of interest. We introduce SynthBH, a synthetic-powered multiple testing procedure that safely leverages such synthetic data. We prove that SynthBH guarantees finite-sample, distribution-free FDR control under a mild PRDS-type positive dependence condition, without requiring the pooled-data p-values to be valid under the null. The proposed method adapts to the (unknown) quality of the synthetic data: it enhances the sample efficiency and may boost the power when synthetic data are of high quality, while controlling the FDR at a user-specified level regardless of their quality. We demonstrate the empirical performance of SynthBH on tabular outlier detection benchmarks and on genomic analyses of drug-cancer sensitivity associations, and further study its properties through controlled experiments on simulated data.]]></description>

Compositional generalization, the ability to reason about novel combinations of familiar concepts, is fundamental to human cognition and a critical challenge for machine learning. Object-centric (OC) representations, which encode a scene as a set of objects, are often argued to support such generalization, but systematic evidence in visually rich settings is limited. We introduce a Visual Question Answering benchmark across three controlled visual worlds (CLEVRTex, Super-CLEVR, and MOVi-C) to measure how well vision encoders, with and without object-centric biases, generalize to unseen combinations of object properties. To ensure a fair and comprehensive comparison, we carefully account for training data diversity, sample size, representation size, downstream model capacity, and compute. We use DINOv2 and SigLIP2, two widely used vision encoders, as the foundation models and their OC counterparts. Our key findings reveal that (1) OC approaches are superior in harder compositional generalization settings; (2) original dense representations surpass OC only on easier settings and typically require substantially more downstream compute; and (3) OC models are more sample efficient, achieving stronger generalization with fewer images, whereas dense encoders catch up or surpass them only with sufficient data and diversity. Overall, object-centric representations offer stronger compositional generalization when any one of dataset size, training data diversity, or downstream compute is constrained.]]></description>

In this work, we study the hardness of approximation of the fair $k$-center problem. Here the data points are partitioned into groups and the task is to choose a prescribed number of data points from each group, called centers, while minimizing the maximum distance from any point to its closest center. Although a polynomial-time $3$-approximation is known for this problem in general metrics, it has remained open whether this approximation guarantee is tight or could be further improved, especially since the unconstrained $k$-center problem admits a polynomial-time factor-$2$ approximation. We resolve this open question by proving that, for every $ε>0$, achieving a $(3-ε)$-approximation is NP-hard, assuming $\text{P} \neq \text{NP}$.
  Our inapproximability results hold even when only two disjoint groups are present and at least one center must be chosen from each group. Further, it extends to the canonical one-per-group setting with $k$-groups (for arbitrary $k$), where exactly one center must be selected from each group. Consequently, the factor-$3$ barrier for fair $k$-center in general metric spaces is inherent, and existing $3$-approximation algorithms are optimal up to lower-order terms even in these restricted regimes. This result stands in sharp contrast to the $k$-supplier formulation, where both the unconstrained and fair variants admit factor-$3$ approximation in polynomial time.]]></description>

Current audio language models are predominantly text-first, either extending pre-trained text LLM backbones or relying on semantic-only audio tokens, limiting general audio modeling. This paper presents a systematic empirical study of native audio foundation models that apply next-token prediction to audio at scale, jointly modeling semantic content, acoustic details, and text to support both general audio generation and cross-modal capabilities. We provide comprehensive empirical insights for building such models: (1) We systematically investigate design choices -- data sources, text mixture ratios, and token composition -- establishing a validated training recipe. (2) We conduct the first scaling law study for discrete audio models via IsoFLOP analysis on 64 models spanning $3{\times}10^{18}$ to $3{\times}10^{20}$ FLOPs, finding that optimal data grows 1.6$\times$ faster than optimal model size. (3) We apply these lessons to train SODA (Scaling Open Discrete Audio), a suite of models from 135M to 4B parameters on 500B tokens, comparing against our scaling predictions and existing models. SODA serves as a flexible backbone for diverse audio/text tasks -- we demonstrate this by fine-tuning for voice-preserving speech-to-speech translation, using the same unified architecture.]]></description>

Matched molecular pairs (MMPs) capture the local chemical edits that medicinal chemists routinely use to design analogs, but existing ML approaches either operate at the whole-molecule level with limited edit controllability or learn MMP-style edits from restricted settings and small models. We propose a variable-to-variable formulation of analog generation and train a foundation model on large-scale MMP transformations (MMPTs) to generate diverse variables conditioned on an input variable. To enable practical control, we develop prompting mechanisms that let the users specify preferred transformation patterns during generation. We further introduce MMPT-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework that uses external reference analogs as contextual guidance to steer generation and generalize from project-specific series. Experiments on general chemical corpora and patent-specific datasets demonstrate improved diversity, novelty, and controllability, and show that our method recovers realistic analog structures in practical discovery scenarios.]]></description>

Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) requires identifying both immediate Point Anomalies and long-range Context Anomalies. However, existing foundation models face a fundamental trade-off: 1D temporal models provide fine-grained pointwise localization but lack a global contextual perspective, while 2D vision-based models capture global patterns but suffer from information bottlenecks due to a lack of temporal alignment and coarse-grained pointwise detection. To resolve this dilemma, we propose VETime, the first TSAD framework that unifies temporal and visual modalities through fine-grained visual-temporal alignment and dynamic fusion. VETime introduces a Reversible Image Conversion and a Patch-Level Temporal Alignment module to establish a shared visual-temporal timeline, preserving discriminative details while maintaining temporal sensitivity. Furthermore, we design an Anomaly Window Contrastive Learning mechanism and a Task-Adaptive Multi-Modal Fusion to adaptively integrate the complementary perceptual strengths of both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VETime significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in zero-shot scenarios, achieving superior localization precision with lower computational overhead than current vision-based approaches.

Clustering-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) organizes a set of points into partitions, and searches only a few of them to find the nearest neighbors of a query. Despite its popularity, there are virtually no analytical tools to determine the suitability of clustering-based ANNS for a given dataset -- what we call "searchability." To address that gap, we present two measures for flat clusterings of high-dimensional points in Euclidean space. First is Clustering-Neighborhood Stability Measure (clustering-NSM), an internal measure of clustering quality -- a function of a clustering of a dataset -- that we show to be predictive of ANNS accuracy. The second, Point-Neighborhood Stability Measure (point-NSM), is a measure of clusterability -- a function of the dataset itself -- that is predictive of clustering-NSM. The two together allow us to determine whether a dataset is searchable by clustering-based ANNS given only the data points. Importantly, both are functions of nearest neighbor relationships between points, not distances, making them applicable to various distance functions including inner product.]]></description>

Automated unit test generation for C remains a formidable challenge due to the semantic gap between high-level program intent and the rigid syntactic constraints of pointer arithmetic and manual memory management. While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong generative capabilities, direct intent-to-code synthesis frequently suffers from the leap-to-code failure mode, where models prematurely emit code without grounding in program structure, constraints, and semantics. This will result in non-compilable tests, hallucinated function signatures, low branch coverage, and semantically irrelevant assertions that cannot properly capture bugs. We introduce SPARC, a neuro-symbolic, scenario-based framework that bridges this gap through four stages: (1) Control Flow Graph (CFG) analysis, (2) an Operation Map that grounds LLM reasoning in validated utility helpers, (3) Path-targeted test synthesis, and (4) an iterative, self-correction validation loop using compiler and runtime feedback. We evaluate SPARC on 59 real-world and algorithmic subjects, where it outperforms the vanilla prompt generation baseline by 31.36% in line coverage, 26.01% in branch coverage, and 20.78% in mutation score, matching or exceeding the symbolic execution tool KLEE on complex subjects. SPARC retains 94.3% of tests through iterative repair and produces code with significantly higher developer-rated readability and maintainability. By aligning LLM reasoning with program structure, SPARC provides a scalable path for industrial-grade testing of legacy C codebases.]]></description>

High-definition (HD) maps are crucial to autonomous driving, providing structured representations of road elements to support navigation and planning. However, existing query-based methods often employ random query initialization and depend on implicit temporal modeling, which lead to temporal inconsistencies and instabilities during the construction of a global map. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel end-to-end framework for consistent online HD vectorized map construction, which jointly performs map instance tracking and short-term prediction. First, we propose a Semantic-Aware Query Generator that initializes queries with spatially aligned semantic masks to capture scene-level context globally. Next, we design a History Rasterized Map Memory to store fine-grained instance-level maps for each tracked instance, enabling explicit historical priors. A History-Map Guidance Module then integrates rasterized map information into track queries, improving temporal continuity. Finally, we propose a Short-Term Future Guidance module to forecast the immediate motion of map instances based on the stored history trajectories. These predicted future locations serve as hints for tracked instances to further avoid implausible predictions and keep temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods with good efficiency.]]></description>

Adversarial diffusion and diffusion-inversion methods have advanced unpaired image-to-image translation, but each faces key limitations. Adversarial approaches require target-domain adversarial loss during training, which can limit generalization to unseen data, while diffusion-inversion methods often produce low-fidelity translations due to imperfect inversion into noise-latent representations. In this work, we propose the Self-Supervised Semantic Bridge (SSB), a versatile framework that integrates external semantic priors into diffusion bridge models to enable spatially faithful translation without cross-domain supervision. Our key idea is to leverage self-supervised visual encoders to learn representations that are invariant to appearance changes but capture geometric structure, forming a shared latent space that conditions the diffusion bridges. Extensive experiments show that SSB outperforms strong prior methods for challenging medical image synthesis in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, and extends easily to high-quality text-guided editing.]]></description>

The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) across linguistic communities necessitates reliable multilingual safety alignment. However, recent efforts to extend alignment to other languages often require substantial resources, either through large-scale, high-quality supervision in the target language or through pairwise alignment with high-resource languages, which limits scalability. In this work, we propose a resource-efficient method for improving multilingual safety alignment. We introduce a plug-and-play Multi-Lingual Consistency (MLC) loss that can be integrated into existing monolingual alignment pipelines. By improving collinearity between multilingual representation vectors, our method encourages directional consistency at the multilingual semantic level in a single update. This allows simultaneous alignment across multiple languages using only multilingual prompt variants without requiring additional response-level supervision in low-resource languages. We validate the proposed method across different model architectures and alignment paradigms, and demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing multilingual safety with limited impact on general model utility. Further evaluation across languages and tasks indicates improved cross-lingual generalization, suggesting the proposed approach as a practical solution for multilingual consistency alignment under limited supervision.]]></description>

The solar dynamo relies on the regeneration of the poloidal magnetic field through processes strongly modulated by nonlinear feedbacks such as tilt quenching (TQ) and latitude quenching (LQ). These mechanisms play a decisive role in regulating the buildup of the Sun's polar field and, in turn, the amplitude of future solar cycles. In this work, we employ Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) to solve the surface flux transport (SFT) equation, embedding physical constraints directly into the neural network framework. By systematically varying transport parameters, we isolate the relative contributions of TQ and LQ to polar dipole buildup. We use the residual dipole moment as a diagnostic for cycle-to-cycle amplification and show that TQ suppression strengthens with increasing diffusivity, while LQ dominates in advection-dominated regimes. The ratio $ΔD_{\mathrm{LQ}}/ΔD_{\mathrm{TQ}}$ exhibits a smooth inverse-square dependence on the dynamo effectivity range, refining previous empirical fits with improved accuracy and reduced scatter. The results further reveal that the need for a decay term is not essential for PINN set-up due to the training process. Compared with the traditional 1D SFT model, the PINN framework achieves significantly lower error metrics and more robust recovery of nonlinear trends. Our results suggest that the nonlinear interplay between LQ and TQ can naturally produce alternations between weak and strong cycles, providing a physical explanation for the observed even-odd cycle modulation. These findings demonstrate the potential of PINN as an accurate, efficient, and physically consistent tool for solar cycle prediction.]]></description>

Agent Skill framework, now widely and officially supported by major players such as GitHub Copilot, LangChain, and OpenAI, performs especially well with proprietary models by improving context engineering, reducing hallucinations, and boosting task accuracy. Based on these observations, an investigation is conducted to determine whether the Agent Skill paradigm provides similar benefits to small language models (SLMs). This question matters in industrial scenarios where continuous reliance on public APIs is infeasible due to data-security and budget constraints requirements, and where SLMs often show limited generalization in highly customized scenarios. This work introduces a formal mathematical definition of the Agent Skill process, followed by a systematic evaluation of language models of varying sizes across multiple use cases. The evaluation encompasses two open-source tasks and a real-world insurance claims data set. The results show that tiny models struggle with reliable skill selection, while moderately sized SLMs (approximately 12B - 30B) parameters) benefit substantially from the Agent Skill approach. Moreover, code-specialized variants at around 80B parameters achieve performance comparable to closed-source baselines while improving GPU efficiency. Collectively, these findings provide a comprehensive and nuanced characterization of the capabilities and constraints of the framework, while providing actionable insights for the effective deployment of Agent Skills in SLM-centered environments.]]></description>

Polymer literature contains a large and growing body of experimental knowledge, yet much of it is buried in unstructured text and inconsistent terminology, making systematic retrieval and reasoning difficult. Existing tools typically extract narrow, study-specific facts in isolation, failing to preserve the cross-study context required to answer broader scientific questions. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a promising way to overcome this limitation by combining large language models (LLMs) with external retrieval, but its effectiveness depends strongly on how domain knowledge is represented. In this work, we develop two retrieval pipelines: a dense semantic vector-based approach (VectorRAG) and a graph-based approach (GraphRAG). Using over 1,000 polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) papers, we construct context-preserving paragraph embeddings and a canonicalized structured knowledge graph supporting entity disambiguation and multi-hop reasoning. We evaluate these pipelines through standard retrieval metrics, comparisons with general state-of-the-art systems such as GPT and Gemini, and qualitative validation by a domain chemist. The results show that GraphRAG achieves higher precision and interpretability, while VectorRAG provides broader recall, highlighting complementary trade-offs. Expert validation further confirms that the tailored pipelines, particularly GraphRAG, produce well-grounded, citation-reliable responses with strong domain relevance. By grounding every statement in evidence, these systems enable researchers to navigate the literature, compare findings across studies, and uncover patterns that are difficult to extract manually. More broadly, this work establishes a practical framework for building materials science assistants using curated corpora and retrieval design, reducing reliance on proprietary models while enabling trustworthy literature analysis at scale.]]></description>

The RNA inverse folding problem aims to identify nucleotide sequences that preferentially adopt a given target secondary structure. While various heuristic and machine learning-based approaches have been proposed, many require a large number of sequence evaluations, which limits their applicability when experimental validation is costly. We propose a method to solve the problem using a factorization machine with quadratic-optimization annealing (FMQA). FMQA is a discrete black-box optimization method reported to obtain high-quality solutions with a limited number of evaluations. Applying FMQA to the problem requires converting nucleotides into binary variables. However, the influence of integer-to-nucleotide assignments and binary-integer encoding on the performance of FMQA has not been thoroughly investigated, even though such choices determine the structure of the surrogate model and the search landscape, and thus can directly affect solution quality. Therefore, this study aims both to establish a novel FMQA framework for RNA inverse folding and to analyze the effects of these assignments and encoding methods. We evaluated all 24 possible assignments of the four nucleotides to the ordered integers (0-3), in combination with four binary-integer encoding methods. Our results demonstrated that one-hot and domain-wall encodings outperform binary and unary encodings in terms of the normalized ensemble defect value. In domain-wall encoding, nucleotides assigned to the boundary integers (0 and 3) appeared with higher frequency. In the RNA inverse folding problem, assigning guanine and cytosine to these boundary integers promoted their enrichment in stem regions, which led to more thermodynamically stable secondary structures than those obtained with one-hot encoding.]]></description>

Neural Collapse (NC) refers to the emergence of highly symmetric geometric structures in the representations of deep neural networks during the terminal phase of training. Despite its prevalence, the theoretical understanding of NC remains limited. Existing analyses largely ignore the role of the optimizer, thereby suggesting that NC is universal across optimization methods. In this work, we challenge this assumption and demonstrate that the choice of optimizer plays a critical role in the emergence of NC. The phenomenon is typically quantified through NC metrics, which, however, are difficult to track and analyze theoretically. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel diagnostic metric, NC0, whose convergence to zero is a necessary condition for NC. Using NC0, we provide theoretical evidence that NC cannot emerge under decoupled weight decay in adaptive optimizers, as implemented in AdamW. Concretely, we prove that SGD, SignGD with coupled weight decay (a special case of Adam), and SignGD with decoupled weight decay (a special case of AdamW) exhibit qualitatively different NC0 dynamics. Also, we show the accelerating effect of momentum on NC (beyond convergence of train loss) when trained with SGD, being the first result concerning momentum in the context of NC. Finally, we conduct extensive empirical experiments consisting of 3,900 training runs across various datasets, architectures, optimizers, and hyperparameters, confirming our theoretical results. This work provides the first theoretical explanation for optimizer-dependent emergence of NC and highlights the overlooked role of weight-decay coupling in shaping the implicit biases of optimizers.]]></description>

The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) but has simultaneously created a "resource divide." State-of-the-art legal intelligence systems typically rely on massive parameter counts (7B+) and cloud-based inference, rendering them inaccessible to practitioners in resource-constrained environments and posing significant data sovereignty risks. This paper introduces Quecto-V1, a domain-specific Small Language Model (SLM) engineered to democratize access to Indian legal intelligence. Built upon a custom configuration of the GPT-2 architecture (124 million parameters), Quecto-V1 was trained from scratch exclusively on a corpus of Indian statutes, including the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), and the Constitution of India. Unlike generalist models, which prioritize broad world knowledge, our approach maximizes "lexical density" within the legal domain. Furthermore, we address the deployment bottleneck by applying post-training 8-bit quantization (GGUF format), compressing the model to a memory footprint of under 150 MB. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that Quecto-V1 achieves high fidelity in retrieving statutory definitions and penal provisions, outperforming general-purpose SLMs in domain-specific exact match tasks while running entirely offline on consumer-grade CPUs. We further present an ablation study showing that 8-bit quantization yields a 74% reduction in model size with less than 3.5% degradation in retrieval accuracy compared to full-precision baselines. These findings suggest that for specialized, high-stakes domains like law, domain-specific training coupled with aggressive quantization offers a viable, privacy-preserving alternative to monolithic cloud models.]]></description>

Evaluating the social intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly requires moving beyond static text generation toward dynamic, adversarial interaction. We introduce the Adversarial Resource Extraction Game (AREG), a benchmark that operationalizes persuasion and resistance as a multi-turn, zero-sum negotiation over financial resources. Using a round-robin tournament across frontier models, AREG enables joint evaluation of offensive (persuasion) and defensive (resistance) capabilities within a single interactional framework. Our analysis provides evidence that these capabilities are weakly correlated ($ρ= 0.33$) and empirically dissociated: strong persuasive performance does not reliably predict strong resistance, and vice versa. Across all evaluated models, resistance scores exceed persuasion scores, indicating a systematic defensive advantage in adversarial dialogue settings. Further linguistic analysis suggests that interaction structure plays a central role in these outcomes. Incremental commitment-seeking strategies are associated with higher extraction success, while verification-seeking responses are more prevalent in successful defenses than explicit refusal. Together, these findings indicate that social influence in LLMs is not a monolithic capability and that evaluation frameworks focusing on persuasion alone may overlook asymmetric behavioral vulnerabilities.]]></description>

The rare-event sampling problem has long been the central limiting factor in molecular dynamics (MD), especially in biomolecular simulation. Recently, diffusion models such as BioEmu have emerged as powerful equilibrium samplers that generate independent samples from complex molecular distributions, eliminating the cost of sampling rare transition events. However, a sampling problem remains when computing observables that rely on states which are rare in equilibrium, for example folding free energies. Here, we introduce enhanced diffusion sampling, enabling efficient exploration of rare-event regions while preserving unbiased thermodynamic estimators. The key idea is to perform quantitatively accurate steering protocols to generate biased ensembles and subsequently recover equilibrium statistics via exact reweighting. We instantiate our framework in three algorithms: UmbrellaDiff (umbrella sampling with diffusion models), $Δ$G-Diff (free-energy differences via tilted ensembles), and MetaDiff (a batchwise analogue for metadynamics). Across toy systems, protein folding landscapes and folding free energies, our methods achieve fast, accurate, and scalable estimation of equilibrium properties within GPU-minutes to hours per system -- closing the rare-event sampling gap that remained after the advent of diffusion-model equilibrium samplers.]]></description>

The average reward is a fundamental performance metric in reinforcement learning (RL) focusing on the long-run performance of an agent. Differential temporal difference (TD) learning algorithms are a major advance for average reward RL as they provide an efficient online method to learn the value functions associated with the average reward in both on-policy and off-policy settings. However, existing convergence guarantees require a local clock in learning rates tied to state visit counts, which practitioners do not use and does not extend beyond tabular settings. We address this limitation by proving the almost sure convergence of on-policy $n$-step differential TD for any $n$ using standard diminishing learning rates without a local clock. We then derive three sufficient conditions under which off-policy $n$-step differential TD also converges without a local clock. These results strengthen the theoretical foundations of differential TD and bring its convergence analysis closer to practical implementations.]]></description>

Recent success in natural language processing has motivated growing interest in large-scale foundation models for neuroimaging data. Such models often require discretization of continuous neural time series data, a process referred to as 'tokenization'. However, the impact of different tokenization strategies for neural data is currently poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of sample-level tokenization strategies for transformer-based large neuroimaging models (LNMs) applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We compare learnable and non-learnable tokenizers by examining their signal reconstruction fidelity and their impact on subsequent foundation modeling performance (token prediction, biological plausibility of generated data, preservation of subject-specific information, and performance on downstream tasks). For the learnable tokenizer, we introduce a novel approach based on an autoencoder. Experiments were conducted on three publicly available MEG datasets spanning different acquisition sites, scanners, and experimental paradigms. Our results show that both learnable and non-learnable discretization schemes achieve high reconstruction accuracy and broadly comparable performance across most evaluation criteria, suggesting that simple fixed sample-level tokenization strategies can be used in the development of neural foundation models. The code is available at https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/Cho2026_Tokenizer.]]></description>

Abstracting from a low level to a more explanatory high level of description, and ideally while preserving causal structure, is fundamental to scientific practice, to causal inference problems, and to robust, efficient and interpretable AI. We present a general account of abstractions between low and high level models as natural transformations, focusing on the case of causal models. This provides a new formalisation of causal abstraction, unifying several notions in the literature, including constructive causal abstraction, Q-$τ$ consistency, abstractions based on interchange interventions, and `distributed' causal abstractions. Our approach is formalised in terms of category theory, and uses the general notion of a compositional model with a given set of queries and semantics in a monoidal, cd- or Markov category; causal models and their queries such as interventions being special cases. We identify two basic notions of abstraction: downward abstractions mapping queries from high to low level; and upward abstractions, mapping concrete queries such as Do-interventions from low to high. Although usually presented as the latter, we show how common causal abstractions may, more fundamentally, be understood in terms of the former. Our approach also leads us to consider a new stronger notion of `component-level' abstraction, applying to the individual components of a model. In particular, this yields a novel, strengthened form of constructive causal abstraction at the mechanism-level, for which we prove characterisation results. Finally, we show that abstraction can be generalised to further compositional models, including those with a quantum semantics implemented by quantum circuits, and we take first steps in exploring abstractions between quantum compositional circuit models and high-level classical causal models as a means to explainable quantum AI.]]></description>

Humans can infer material characteristics of objects from their visual appearance, and this ability extends to artistic depictions, where similar perceptual strategies guide the interpretation of paintings or drawings. Among the factors that define material appearance, gloss, along with color, is widely regarded as one of the most important, and recent studies indicate that humans can perceive gloss independently of the artistic style used to depict an object. To investigate how gloss and artistic style are represented in learned models, we train an unsupervised generative model on a newly curated dataset of painterly objects designed to systematically vary such factors. Our analysis reveals a hierarchical latent space in which gloss is disentangled from other appearance factors, allowing for a detailed study of how gloss is represented and varies across artistic styles. Building on this representation, we introduce a lightweight adapter that connects our style- and gloss-aware latent space to a latent-diffusion model, enabling the synthesis of non-photorealistic images with fine-grained control of these factors. We compare our approach with previous models and observe improved disentanglement and controllability of the learned factors.]]></description>

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied as automatic evaluators for natural language generation assessment often using pairwise comparative judgements. Existing approaches typically rely on single judges or aggregate multiple judges assuming equal reliability. In practice, LLM judges vary substantially in performance across tasks and aspects, and their judgment probabilities may be biased and inconsistent. Furthermore, human-labelled supervision for judge calibration may be unavailable. We first empirically demonstrate that inconsistencies in LLM comparison probabilities exist and show that it limits the effectiveness of direct probability-based ranking. To address this, we study the LLM-as-a-jury setting and propose BT-sigma, a judge-aware extension of the Bradley-Terry model that introduces a discriminator parameter for each judge to jointly infer item rankings and judge reliability from pairwise comparisons alone. Experiments on benchmark NLG evaluation datasets show that BT-sigma consistently outperforms averaging-based aggregation methods, and that the learned discriminator strongly correlates with independent measures of the cycle consistency of LLM judgments. Further analysis reveals that BT-sigma can be interpreted as an unsupervised calibration mechanism that improves aggregation by modelling judge reliability.]]></description>

Current state-of-the-art multi-vector models are obtained through a small Knowledge Distillation (KD) training step on top of strong single-vector models, leveraging the large-scale pre-training of these models. In this paper, we study the pre-training of multi-vector models and show that large-scale multi-vector pre-training yields much stronger multi-vector models. Notably, a fully ColBERT-pre-trained model, ColBERT-Zero, trained only on public data, outperforms GTE-ModernColBERT as well as its base model, GTE-ModernBERT, which leverages closed and much stronger data, setting new state-of-the-art for model this size. We also find that, although performing only a small KD step is not enough to achieve results close to full pre-training, adding a supervised step beforehand allows to achieve much closer performance while skipping the most costly unsupervised phase. Finally, we find that aligning the fine-tuning and pre-training setups is crucial when repurposing existing models. To enable exploration of our results, we release various checkpoints as well as code used to train them.]]></description>

Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains and tasks, yet their deeply layered representations make their predictions difficult to interpret. Existing explainability methods rely on final-layer attributions, capture either local token-level attributions or global attention patterns without unification, and lack context-awareness of inter-token dependencies and structural components. They also fail to capture how relevance evolves across layers and how structural components shape decision-making. To address these limitations, we proposed the \textbf{Context-Aware Layer-wise Integrated Gradients (CA-LIG) Framework}, a unified hierarchical attribution framework that computes layer-wise Integrated Gradients within each Transformer block and fuses these token-level attributions with class-specific attention gradients. This integration yields signed, context-sensitive attribution maps that capture supportive and opposing evidence while tracing the hierarchical flow of relevance through the Transformer layers. We evaluate the CA-LIG Framework across diverse tasks, domains, and transformer model families, including sentiment analysis and long and multi-class document classification with BERT, hate speech detection in a low-resource language setting with XLM-R and AfroLM, and image classification with Masked Autoencoder vision Transformer model. Across all tasks and architectures, CA-LIG provides more faithful attributions, shows stronger sensitivity to contextual dependencies, and produces clearer, more semantically coherent visualizations than established explainability methods. These results indicate that CA-LIG provides a more comprehensive, context-aware, and reliable explanation of Transformer decision-making, advancing both the practical interpretability and conceptual understanding of deep neural models.]]></description>

Municipal meeting minutes are formal records documenting the discussions and decisions of local government, yet their content is often lengthy, dense, and difficult for citizens to navigate. Automatic summarization can help address this challenge by producing concise summaries for each discussion subject. Despite its potential, research on summarizing discussion subjects in municipal meeting minutes remains largely unexplored, especially in low-resource languages, where the inherent complexity of these documents adds further challenges. A major bottleneck is the scarcity of datasets containing high-quality, manually crafted summaries, which limits the development and evaluation of effective summarization models for this domain. In this paper, we present CitiLink-Summ, a new corpus of European Portuguese municipal meeting minutes, comprising 100 documents and 2,322 manually hand-written summaries, each corresponding to a distinct discussion subject. Leveraging this dataset, we establish baseline results for automatic summarization in this domain, employing state-of-the-art generative models (e.g., BART, PRIMERA) as well as large language models (LLMs), evaluated with both lexical and semantic metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, and BERTScore. CitiLink-Summ provides the first benchmark for municipal-domain summarization in European Portuguese, offering a valuable resource for advancing NLP research on complex administrative texts.]]></description>

The growing demand for large language models (LLMs) requires serving systems to handle many concurrent requests with diverse service level objectives (SLOs). This exacerbates head-of-line (HoL) blocking during the compute-intensive prefill phase, where long-running requests monopolize resources and delay higher-priority ones, leading to widespread time-to-first-token (TTFT) SLO violations. While chunked prefill enables interruptibility, it introduces an inherent trade-off between responsiveness and throughput: reducing chunk size improves response latency but degrades computational efficiency, whereas increasing chunk size maximizes throughput but exacerbates blocking. This necessitates an adaptive preemption mechanism. However, dynamically balancing execution granularity against scheduling overheads remains a key challenge.
  In this paper, we propose FlowPrefill, a TTFT-goodput-optimized serving system that resolves this conflict by decoupling preemption granularity from scheduling frequency. To achieve adaptive prefill scheduling, FlowPrefill introduces two key innovations: 1) Operator-Level Preemption, which leverages operator boundaries to enable fine-grained execution interruption without the efficiency loss associated with fixed small chunking; and 2) Event-Driven Scheduling, which triggers scheduling decisions only upon request arrival or completion events, thereby supporting efficient preemption responsiveness while minimizing control-plane overhead. Evaluation on real-world production traces shows that FlowPrefill improves maximum goodput by up to 5.6$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art systems while satisfying heterogeneous SLOs.]]></description>

Machine learning models are increasingly trained or fine-tuned on synthetic data. Recursively training on such data has been observed to significantly degrade performance in a wide range of tasks, often characterized by a progressive drift away from the target distribution. In this work, we theoretically analyze this phenomenon in the setting of score-based diffusion models. For a realistic pipeline where each training round uses a combination of synthetic data and fresh samples from the target distribution, we obtain upper and lower bounds on the accumulated divergence between the generated and target distributions. This allows us to characterize different regimes of drift, depending on the score estimation error and the proportion of fresh data used in each generation. We also provide empirical results on synthetic data and images to illustrate the theory.]]></description>

Cops and Robbers is a pursuit evasion game played on a graph, first introduced independently by Quilliot \cite{quilliot1978jeux} and Nowakowski and Winkler \cite{NOWAKOWSKI1983235} over four decades ago. A main interest in recent the literature is identifying the cop number of graph families. The cop number of a graph, $c(G)$, is defined as the minimum number of cops required to guarantee capture of the robber. Determining the cop number is computationally difficult and exact algorithms for this are typically restricted to small graph families. This paper investigates whether classical machine learning methods and graph neural networks can accurately predict a graph's cop number from its structural properties and identify which properties most strongly influence this prediction. Of the classical machine learning models, tree-based models achieve high accuracy in prediction despite class imbalance, whereas graph neural networks achieve comparable results without explicit feature engineering. The interpretability analysis shows that the most predictive features are related to node connectivity, clustering, clique structure, and width parameters, which aligns with known theoretical results. Our findings suggest that machine learning approaches can be used in complement with existing cop number algorithms by offering scalable approximations where computation is infeasible.]]></description>

Modern AI models are not static. They go through multiple updates in their lifecycles. Thus, exploiting the model dynamics to create stronger Membership Inference (MI) attacks and tighter privacy audits are timely questions. Though the literature empirically shows that using a sequence of model updates can increase the power of MI attacks, rigorous analysis of the `optimal' MI attacks is limited to static models with infinite samples. Hence, we develop an `optimal' MI attack, SeMI*, that uses the sequence of model updates to identify the presence of a target inserted at a certain update step. For the empirical mean computation, we derive the optimal power of SeMI*, while accessing a finite number of samples with or without privacy. Our results retrieve the existing asymptotic analysis. We observe that having access to the model sequence avoids the dilution of MI signals unlike the existing attacks on the final model, where the MI signal vanishes as training data accumulates. Furthermore, an adversary can use SeMI* to tune both the insertion time and the canary to yield tighter privacy audits. Finally, we conduct experiments across data distributions and models trained or fine-tuned with DP-SGD demonstrating that practical variants of SeMI* lead to tighter privacy audits than the baselines.]]></description>

Street-view image attribute classification is a vital downstream task of image classification, enabling applications such as autonomous driving, urban analytics, and high-definition map construction. It remains computationally demanding whether training from scratch, initialising from pre-trained weights, or fine-tuning large models. Although pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP offer rich image representations, existing adaptation or fine-tuning methods often rely on their global image embeddings, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained, localised attributes essential in complex, cluttered street scenes. To address this, we propose CLIP-MHAdapter, a variant of the current lightweight CLIP adaptation paradigm that appends a bottleneck MLP equipped with multi-head self-attention operating on patch tokens to model inter-patch dependencies. With approximately 1.4 million trainable parameters, CLIP-MHAdapter achieves superior or competitive accuracy across eight attribute classification tasks on the Global StreetScapes dataset, attaining new state-of-the-art results while maintaining low computational cost. The code is available at https://github.com/SpaceTimeLab/CLIP-MHAdapter.]]></description>

Operational rigor determines whether human-agent collaboration succeeds or fails. Scientific data pipelines need the equivalent of DevOps -- SciOps -- yet common approaches fragment provenance across disconnected systems without transactional guarantees. DataJoint 2.0 addresses this gap through the relational workflow model: tables represent workflow steps, rows represent artifacts, foreign keys prescribe execution order. The schema specifies not only what data exists but how it is derived -- a single formal system where data structure, computational dependencies, and integrity constraints are all queryable, enforceable, and machine-readable. Four technical innovations extend this foundation: object-augmented schemas integrating relational metadata with scalable object storage, semantic matching using attribute lineage to prevent erroneous joins, an extensible type system for domain-specific formats, and distributed job coordination designed for composability with external orchestration. By unifying data structure, data, and computational transformations, DataJoint creates a substrate for SciOps where agents can participate in scientific workflows without risking data corruption.]]></description>

Reliable global streamflow forecasting is essential for flood preparedness and water resource management, yet data-driven models often suffer from a performance gap when transitioning from historical reanalysis to operational forecast products. This paper introduces AIFL (Artificial Intelligence for Floods), a deterministic LSTM-based model designed for global daily streamflow forecasting. Trained on 18,588 basins curated from the CARAVAN dataset, AIFL utilises a novel two-stage training strategy to bridge the reanalysis-to-forecast domain shift. The model is first pre-trained on 40 years of ERA5-Land reanalysis (1980-2019) to capture robust hydrological processes, then fine-tuned on operational Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) control forecasts (2016-2019) to adapt to the specific error structures and biases of operational numerical weather prediction. To our knowledge, this is the first global model trained end-to-end within the CARAVAN ecosystem. On an independent temporal test set (2021-2024), AIFL achieves high predictive skill with a median modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE') of 0.66 and a median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.53. Benchmarking results show that AIFL is highly competitive with current state-of-the-art global systems, achieving comparable accuracy while maintaining a transparent and reproducible forcing pipeline. The model demonstrates exceptional reliability in extreme-event detection, providing a streamlined and operationally robust baseline for the global hydrological community.]]></description>

Can a machine write good poetry? Any positive answer raises fundamental questions about the nature and value of art. We report a seven-month poetry workshop in which a large language model was shaped into a digital poet through iterative in-context expert feedback, without retraining. Across sessions, the model developed a distinctive style and a coherent corpus, supported by quantitative and qualitative analyses, and it produced a pen name and author image. In a blinded authorship test with 50 humanities students and graduates (three AI poems and three poems by well-known poets each), judgments were at chance: human poems were labeled human 54% of the time and AI poems 52%, with 95% confidence intervals including 50%. After the workshop, a commercial publisher released a poetry collection authored by the model. These results show that workshop-style prompting can support long-horizon creative shaping and renew debates on creativity and authorship.]]></description>

Urban demand forecasting plays a critical role in optimizing routing, dispatching, and congestion management within Intelligent Transportation Systems. By leveraging data fusion and analytics techniques, traffic demand forecasting serves as a key intermediate measure for identifying emerging spatial and temporal demand patterns. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by proposing two gradient boosting model variations, one for classiffication and one for regression, both capable of generating demand forecasts at various temporal horizons, from 5 minutes up to one hour. Our overall approach effectively integrates temporal and contextual features, enabling accurate predictions that are essential for improving the efficiency of shared (micro-) mobility services. To evaluate its effectiveness, we utilize open shared mobility data derived from e-scooter and e-bike networks in five metropolitan areas. These real-world datasets allow us to compare our approach with state-of-the-art methods as well as a Generative AI-based model, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the complexities of modern urban mobility. Ultimately, our methodology offers novel insights on urban micro-mobility management, helping to tackle the challenges arising from rapid urbanization and thus, contributing to more sustainable, efficient, and livable cities.]]></description>

Large-scale sharing of dialogue-based data is instrumental for advancing the science of teaching and learning, yet rigorous de-identification remains a major barrier. In mathematics tutoring transcripts, numeric expressions frequently resemble structured identifiers (e.g., dates or IDs), leading generic Personally Identifiable Information (PII) detection systems to over-redact core instructional content and reduce dataset utility. This work asks how PII can be detected in math tutoring transcripts while preserving their educational utility. To address this challenge, we investigate the "numeric ambiguity" problem and introduce MathEd-PII, the first benchmark dataset for PII detection in math tutoring dialogues, created through a human-in-the-loop LLM workflow that audits upstream redactions and generates privacy-preserving surrogates. The dataset contains 1,000 tutoring sessions (115,620 messages; 769,628 tokens) with validated PII annotations. Using a density-based segmentation method, we show that false PII redactions are disproportionately concentrated in math-dense regions, confirming numeric ambiguity as a key failure mode. We then compare four detection strategies: a Presidio baseline and LLM-based approaches with basic, math-aware, and segment-aware prompting. Math-aware prompting substantially improves performance over the baseline (F1: 0.821 vs. 0.379) while reducing numeric false positives, demonstrating that de-identification must incorporate domain context to preserve analytic utility. This work provides both a new benchmark and evidence that utility-preserving de-identification for tutoring data requires domain-aware modeling.]]></description>

Inference-time algorithms are an emerging paradigm in which pre-trained models are used as subroutines to solve downstream tasks. Such algorithms have been proposed for tasks ranging from inverse problems and guided image generation to reasoning. However, the methods currently deployed in practice are heuristics with a variety of failure modes -- and we have very little understanding of when these heuristics can be efficiently improved.
  In this paper, we consider the task of sampling from a reward-tilted diffusion model -- that is, sampling from $p^{\star}(x) \propto p(x) \exp(r(x))$ -- given a reward function $r$ and pre-trained diffusion oracle for $p$. We provide a fine-grained analysis of the computational tractability of this task for quadratic rewards $r(x) = x^\top A x + b^\top x$. We show that linear-reward tilts are always efficiently sampleable -- a simple result that seems to have gone unnoticed in the literature. We use this as a building block, along with a conceptually new ingredient -- the Hubbard-Stratonovich transform -- to provide an efficient algorithm for sampling from low-rank positive-definite quadratic tilts, i.e. $r(x) = x^\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite and of rank $O(1)$. For negative-definite tilts, i.e. $r(x) = - x^\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite, we prove that the problem is intractable even if $A$ is of rank 1 (albeit with exponentially-large entries).]]></description>

Face morphing attacks are widely recognized as one of the most challenging threats to face recognition systems used in electronic identity documents. These attacks exploit a critical vulnerability in passport enrollment procedures adopted by many countries, where the facial image is often acquired without a supervised live capture process. In this paper, we propose a novel face morphing technique based on Arc2Face, an identity-conditioned face foundation model capable of synthesizing photorealistic facial images from compact identity representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing the morphing attack potential metric on two large-scale sequestered face morphing attack detection datasets against several state-of-the-art morphing methods, as well as on two novel morphed face datasets derived from FEI and ONOT. Experimental results show that the proposed deep learning-based approach achieves a morphing attack potential comparable to that of landmark-based techniques, which have traditionally been regarded as the most challenging. These findings confirm the ability of the proposed method to effectively preserve and manage identity information during the morph generation process.]]></description>

Sparse recovery is among the most well-studied problems in learning theory and high-dimensional statistics. In this work, we investigate the statistical and computational landscapes of sparse recovery with $\ell_\infty$ error guarantees. This variant of the problem is motivated by \emph{variable selection} tasks, where the goal is to estimate the support of a $k$-sparse signal in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Our main contribution is a provable separation between the \emph{oblivious} (``for each'') and \emph{adaptive} (``for all'') models of $\ell_\infty$ sparse recovery. We show that under an oblivious model, the optimal $\ell_\infty$ error is attainable in near-linear time with $\approx k\log d$ samples, whereas in an adaptive model, $\gtrsim k^2$ samples are necessary for any algorithm to achieve this bound. This establishes a surprising contrast with the standard $\ell_2$ setting, where $\approx k \log d$ samples suffice even for adaptive sparse recovery. We conclude with a preliminary examination of a \emph{partially-adaptive} model, where we show nontrivial variable selection guarantees are possible with $\approx k\log d$ measurements.]]></description>

We introduce MetaDOAR, a lightweight meta-controller that augments the Double Oracle / PSRO paradigm with a learned, partition-aware filtering layer and Q-value caching to enable scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning on very large cyber-network environments. MetaDOAR learns a compact state projection from per node structural embeddings to rapidly score and select a small subset of devices (a top-k partition) on which a conventional low-level actor performs focused beam search utilizing a critic agent. Selected candidate actions are evaluated with batched critic forwards and stored in an LRU cache keyed by a quantized state projection and local action identifiers, dramatically reducing redundant critic computation while preserving decision quality via conservative k-hop cache invalidation. Empirically, MetaDOAR attains higher player payoffs than SOTA baselines on large network topologies, without significant scaling issues in terms of memory usage or training time. This contribution provide a practical, theoretically motivated path to efficient hierarchical policy learning for large-scale networked decision problems.]]></description>

Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for quantum machine learning in the NISQ era. While parameter sharing in VQCs can reduce the parameter space dimensionality and potentially mitigate the barren plateau phenomenon, it introduces a complex trade-off that has been largely overlooked. This paper investigates how parameter sharing, despite creating better global optima with fewer parameters, fundamentally alters the optimization landscape through deceptive gradients -- regions where gradient information exists but systematically misleads optimizers away from global optima. Through systematic experimental analysis, we demonstrate that increasing degrees of parameter sharing generate more complex solution landscapes with heightened gradient magnitudes and measurably higher deceptiveness ratios. Our findings reveal that traditional gradient-based optimizers (Adam, SGD) show progressively degraded convergence as parameter sharing increases, with performance heavily dependent on hyperparameter selection. We introduce a novel gradient deceptiveness detection algorithm and a quantitative framework for measuring optimization difficulty in quantum circuits, establishing that while parameter sharing can improve circuit expressivity by orders of magnitude, this comes at the cost of significantly increased landscape deceptiveness. These insights provide important considerations for quantum circuit design in practical applications, highlighting the fundamental mismatch between classical optimization strategies and quantum parameter landscapes shaped by parameter sharing.]]></description>

We analyze independent policy-gradient (PG) learning in $N$-player linear-quadratic (LQ) stochastic differential games. Each player employs a distributed policy that depends only on its own state and updates the policy independently using the gradient of its own objective. We establish global linear convergence of these methods to an equilibrium by showing that the LQ game admits an $α$-potential structure, with $α$ determined by the degree of pairwise interaction asymmetry. For pairwise-symmetric interactions, we construct an affine distributed equilibrium by minimizing the potential function and show that independent PG methods converge globally to this equilibrium, with complexity scaling linearly in the population size and logarithmically in the desired accuracy. For asymmetric interactions, we prove that independent projected PG algorithms converge linearly to an approximate equilibrium, with suboptimality proportional to the degree of asymmetry. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results across both symmetric and asymmetric interaction networks.]]></description>

We introduce MerLean, a fully automated agentic framework for autoformalization in quantum computation. MerLean extracts mathematical statements from \LaTeX{} source files, formalizes them into verified Lean~4 code built on Mathlib, and translates the result back into human-readable \LaTeX{} for semantic review. We evaluate MerLean on three theoretical quantum computing papers producing 2,050 Lean declarations from 114 statements in total. MerLean achieves end-to-end formalization on all three papers, reducing the verification burden to only the newly introduced definitions and axioms. Our results demonstrate that agentic autoformalization can scale to frontier research, offering both a practical tool for machine-verified peer review and a scalable engine for mining high-quality synthetic data to train future reasoning models. Our approach can also be generalized to any other rigorous research in mathematics and theoretical physics.]]></description>

The inverse design of RNA three-dimensional (3D) structures is crucial for engineering functional RNAs in synthetic biology and therapeutics. While recent deep learning approaches have advanced this field, they are typically optimized and evaluated using native sequence recovery, which is a limited surrogate for structural fidelity, since different sequences can fold into similar 3D structures and high recovery does not necessarily indicate correct folding. To address this limitation, we propose RIDER, an RNA Inverse DEsign framework with Reinforcement learning that directly optimizes for 3D structural similarity. First, we develop and pre-train a GNN-based generative diffusion model conditioned on the target 3D structure, achieving a 9% improvement in native sequence recovery over state-of-the-art methods. Then, we fine-tune the model with an improved policy gradient algorithm using four task-specific reward functions based on 3D self-consistency metrics. Experimental results show that RIDER improves structural similarity by over 100% across all metrics and discovers designs that are distinct from native sequences.]]></description>

Video recognition models are typically trained on fixed taxonomies which are often too coarse, collapsing distinctions in object, manner or outcome under a single label. As tasks and definitions evolve, such models cannot accommodate emerging distinctions and collecting new annotations and retraining to accommodate such changes is costly. To address these challenges, we introduce category splitting, a new task where an existing classifier is edited to refine a coarse category into finer subcategories, while preserving accuracy elsewhere. We propose a zero-shot editing method that leverages the latent compositional structure of video classifiers to expose fine-grained distinctions without additional data. We further show that low-shot fine-tuning, while simple, is highly effective and benefits from our zero-shot initialization. Experiments on our new video benchmarks for category splitting demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms vision-language baselines, improving accuracy on the newly split categories without sacrificing performance on the rest.

Safe reinforcement learning (Safe RL) aims to ensure policy performance while satisfying safety constraints. However, most existing Safe RL methods assume benign environments, making them vulnerable to adversarial perturbations commonly encountered in real-world settings. In addition, existing gradient-based adversarial attacks typically require access to the policy's gradient information, which is often impractical in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose an adversarial attack framework to reveal vulnerabilities of Safe RL policies. Using expert demonstrations and black-box environment interaction, our framework learns a constraint model and a surrogate (learner) policy, enabling gradient-based attack optimization without requiring the victim policy's internal gradients or the ground-truth safety constraints. We further provide theoretical analysis establishing feasibility and deriving perturbation bounds. Experiments on multiple Safe RL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach under limited privileged access.]]></description>

We study online conformal prediction for non-stationary data streams subject to unknown distribution drift. While most prior work studied this problem under adversarial settings and/or assessed performance in terms of gaps of time-averaged marginal coverage, we instead evaluate performance through training-conditional cumulative regret. We specifically focus on independently generated data with two types of distribution shift: abrupt change points and smooth drift.
  When non-conformity score functions are pretrained on an independent dataset, we propose a split-conformal style algorithm that leverages drift detection to adaptively update calibration sets, which provably achieves minimax-optimal regret. When non-conformity scores are instead trained online, we develop a full-conformal style algorithm that again incorporates drift detection to handle non-stationarity; this approach relies on stability - rather than permutation symmetry - of the model-fitting algorithm, which is often better suited to online learning under evolving environments. We establish non-asymptotic regret guarantees for our online full conformal algorithm, which match the minimax lower bound under appropriate restrictions on the prediction sets. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical findings.]]></description>

We study transfer learning for a linear regression task using several least-squares pretrained models that can be overparameterized.
  We formulate the target learning task as optimization that minimizes squared errors on the target dataset with penalty on the distance of the learned model from the pretrained models. We analytically formulate the test error of the learned target model and provide the corresponding empirical evaluations.
  Our results elucidate when using more pretrained models can improve transfer learning. Specifically, if the pretrained models are overparameterized, using sufficiently many of them is important for beneficial transfer learning. However, the learning may be compromised by overparameterization bias of pretrained models, i.e., the minimum $\ell_2$-norm solution's restriction to a small subspace spanned by the training examples in the high-dimensional parameter space. We propose a simple debiasing via multiplicative correction factor that can reduce the overparameterization bias and leverage more pretrained models to learn a target predictor.]]></description>

Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a compelling alternative to multilayer perceptrons, offering enhanced interpretability via functional decomposition. However, existing KAN architectures, including spline-, wavelet-, radial-basis variants, etc., suffer from high computational cost and slow convergence, limiting scalability and practical applicability. Here, we introduce Feature-Enriched Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (FEKAN), a simple yet effective extension that preserves all the advantages of KAN while improving computational efficiency and predictive accuracy through feature enrichment, without increasing the number of trainable parameters. By incorporating these additional features, FEKAN accelerates convergence, increases representation capacity, and substantially mitigates the computational overhead characteristic of state-of-the-art KAN architectures. We investigate FEKAN across a comprehensive set of benchmarks, including function-approximation tasks, physics-informed formulations for diverse partial differential equations (PDEs), and neural operator settings that map between input and output function spaces. For function approximation, we systematically compare FEKAN against a broad family of KAN variants, FastKAN, WavKAN, ReLUKAN, HRKAN, ChebyshevKAN, RBFKAN, and the original SplineKAN. Across all tasks, FEKAN demonstrates substantially faster convergence and consistently higher approximation accuracy than the underlying baseline architectures. We also establish the theoretical foundations for FEKAN, showing its superior representation capacity compared to KAN, which contributes to improved accuracy and efficiency.]]></description>

This paper presents a capacity-constrained incentive-based demand response approach for residential smart grids. It aims to maintain electricity grid capacity limits and prevent congestion by financially incentivising end users to reduce or shift their energy consumption. The proposed framework adopts a hierarchical architecture in which a service provider adjusts hourly incentive rates based on wholesale electricity prices and aggregated residential load. The financial interests of both the service provider and end users are explicitly considered. A deep reinforcement learning approach is employed to learn optimal real-time incentive rates under explicit capacity constraints. Heterogeneous user preferences are modelled through appliance-level home energy management systems and dissatisfaction costs. Using real-world residential electricity consumption and price data from three households, simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively reduces peak demand and smooths the aggregated load profile. This leads to an approximately 22.82% reduction in the peak-to-average ratio compared to the no-demand-response case.]]></description>

We extend directed quantum circuit synthesis (DQCS) with reinforcement learning from purely discrete gate selection to parameterized quantum state preparation with continuous single-qubit rotations \(R_x\), \(R_y\), and \(R_z\). We compare two training regimes: a one-stage agent that jointly selects the gate type, the affected qubit(s), and the rotation angle; and a two-stage variant that first proposes a discrete circuit and subsequently optimizes the rotation angles with Adam using parameter-shift gradients. Using Gymnasium and PennyLane, we evaluate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Advantage Actor--Critic (A2C) on systems comprising two to ten qubits and on targets of increasing complexity with \(λ\) ranging from one to five. Whereas A2C does not learn effective policies in this setting, PPO succeeds under stable hyperparameters (one-stage: learning rate approximately \(5\times10^{-4}\) with a self-fidelity-error threshold of 0.01; two-stage: learning rate approximately \(10^{-4}\)). Both approaches reliably reconstruct computational basis states (between 83\% and 99\% success) and Bell states (between 61\% and 77\% success). However, scalability saturates for \(λ\) of approximately three to four and does not extend to ten-qubit targets even at \(λ=2\). The two-stage method offers only marginal accuracy gains while requiring around three times the runtime. For practicality under a fixed compute budget, we therefore recommend the one-stage PPO policy, provide explicit synthesized circuits, and contrast with a classical variational baseline to outline avenues for improved scalability.]]></description>

Jailbreak prompts are a practical and evolving threat to large language models (LLMs), particularly in agentic systems that execute tools over untrusted content. Many attacks exploit long-context hiding, semantic camouflage, and lightweight obfuscations that can evade single-pass guardrails. We present RLM-JB, an end-to-end jailbreak detection framework built on Recursive Language Models (RLMs), in which a root model orchestrates a bounded analysis program that transforms the input, queries worker models over covered segments, and aggregates evidence into an auditable decision. RLM-JB treats detection as a procedure rather than a one-shot classification: it normalizes and de-obfuscates suspicious inputs, chunks text to reduce context dilution and guarantee coverage, performs parallel chunk screening, and composes cross-chunk signals to recover split-payload attacks. On AutoDAN-style adversarial inputs, RLM-JB achieves high detection effectiveness across three LLM backends (ASR/Recall 92.5-98.0%) while maintaining very high precision (98.99-100%) and low false positive rates (0.0-2.0%), highlighting a practical sensitivity-specificity trade-off as the screening backend changes.]]></description>

This paper introduces ParlaCAP, a large-scale dataset for analyzing parliamentary agenda setting across Europe, and proposes a cost-effective method for building domain-specific policy topic classifiers. Applying the Comparative Agendas Project (CAP) schema to the multilingual ParlaMint corpus of over 8 million speeches from 28 parliaments of European countries and autonomous regions, we follow a teacher-student framework in which a high-performing large language model (LLM) annotates in-domain training data and a multilingual encoder model is fine-tuned on these annotations for scalable data annotation. We show that this approach produces a classifier tailored to the target domain. Agreement between the LLM and human annotators is comparable to inter-annotator agreement among humans, and the resulting model outperforms existing CAP classifiers trained on manually-annotated but out-of-domain data. In addition to the CAP annotations, the ParlaCAP dataset offers rich speaker and party metadata, as well as sentiment predictions coming from the ParlaSent multilingual transformer model, enabling comparative research on political attention and representation across countries. We illustrate the analytical potential of the dataset with three use cases, examining the distribution of parliamentary attention across policy topics, sentiment patterns in parliamentary speech, and gender differences in policy attention.]]></description>

Prompting schemes such as Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts, and Graph of Thoughts can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, most existing schemes require users to define static, problem-specific reasoning structures that lack adaptability to dynamic or unseen problem types. Additionally, these schemes are often under-optimized in terms of hyperparameters, prompts, runtime, and prompting cost. To address these limitations, we introduce Framework of Thoughts (FoT)--a general-purpose foundation framework for building and optimizing dynamic reasoning schemes. FoT comes with built-in features for hyperparameter tuning, prompt optimization, parallel execution, and intelligent caching, unlocking the latent performance potential of reasoning schemes. We demonstrate FoT's capabilities by implementing three popular schemes--Tree of Thoughts, Graph of Thoughts, and ProbTree--within FoT. We empirically show that FoT enables significantly faster execution, reduces costs, and achieves better task scores through optimization. We release our codebase to facilitate the development of future dynamic and efficient reasoning schemes.]]></description>

One of the central challenges in the computational analysis of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data is to identify the compounds underlying the output spectra. In recent years, this problem is increasingly tackled using deep learning methods. A common strategy involves predicting a molecular fingerprint vector from an input mass spectrum, which is then used to search for matches in a chemical compound database. While various loss functions are employed in training these predictive models, their impact on model performance remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigate commonly used loss functions, deriving novel regret bounds that characterize when Bayes-optimal decisions for these objectives must diverge. Our results reveal a fundamental trade-off between the two objectives of (1) fingerprint similarity and (2) molecular retrieval. Optimizing for more accurate fingerprint predictions typically worsens retrieval results, and vice versa. Our theoretical analysis shows this trade-off depends on the similarity structure of candidate sets, providing guidance for loss function and fingerprint selection.]]></description>

Hazard and survival functions are natural, interpretable targets in time-to-event prediction, but their inherent non-additivity fundamentally limits standard additive explanation methods. We introduce Survival Functional Decomposition (SurvFD), a principled approach for analyzing feature interactions in machine learning survival models. By decomposing higher-order effects into time-dependent and time-independent components, SurvFD offers a previously unrecognized perspective on survival explanations, explicitly characterizing when and why additive explanations fail. Building on this theoretical decomposition, we propose SurvSHAP-IQ, which extends Shapley interactions to time-indexed functions, providing a practical estimator for higher-order, time-dependent interactions. Together, SurvFD and SurvSHAP-IQ establish an interaction- and time-aware interpretability approach for survival modeling, with broad applicability across time-to-event prediction tasks.]]></description>

Generalized additive models (GAMs) offer interpretability through independent univariate feature effects but underfit when interactions are present in data. GA$^2$Ms add selected pairwise interactions which improves accuracy, but sacrifices interpretability and limits model auditing. We propose \emph{Conditionally Additive Local Models} (CALMs), a new model class, that balances the interpretability of GAMs with the accuracy of GA$^2$Ms. CALMs allow multiple univariate shape functions per feature, each active in different regions of the input space. These regions are defined independently for each feature as simple logical conditions (thresholds) on the features it interacts with. As a result, effects remain locally additive while varying across subregions to capture interactions. We further propose a principled distillation-based training pipeline that identifies homogeneous regions with limited interactions and fits interpretable shape functions via region-aware backfitting. Experiments on diverse classification and regression tasks show that CALMs consistently outperform GAMs and achieve accuracy comparable with GA$^2$Ms. Overall, CALMs offer a compelling trade-off between predictive accuracy and interpretability.]]></description>

Recent advances in garment pattern generation have shown promising progress. However, existing feed-forward methods struggle with diverse poses and viewpoints, while optimization-based approaches are computationally expensive and difficult to scale. This paper focuses on sewing pattern generation for garment modeling and fabrication applications that demand editable, separable, and simulation-ready garments. We propose DressWild, a novel feed-forward pipeline that reconstructs physics-consistent 2D sewing patterns and the corresponding 3D garments from a single in-the-wild image. Given an input image, our method leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to normalize pose variations at the image level, then extract pose-aware, 3D-informed garment features. These features are fused through a transformer-based encoder and subsequently used to predict sewing pattern parameters, which can be directly applied to physical simulation, texture synthesis, and multi-layer virtual try-on. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach robustly recovers diverse sewing patterns and the corresponding 3D garments from in-the-wild images without requiring multi-view inputs or iterative optimization, offering an efficient and scalable solution for realistic garment simulation and animation.]]></description>

Soft prompt tuning leverages continuous embeddings to capture task-specific information in large pre-trained language models (LLMs), achieving competitive performance in few-shot settings. However, soft prompts rely on high-dimensional, implicit representations and lack explicit semantics and traceable training behaviors, which limits their interpretability. To address this limitation, we propose a soft prompt tuning optimization method based on topological morphological evolution. Specifically, we employ persistent homology from topological data analysis (TDA) to quantify the structural representations of soft prompts in continuous parameter space and their training process evolution. Quantitative analysis shows that topologically stable and compact soft prompts achieve better downstream performance. Based on this empirical observation, we construct a loss function for optimizing soft prompt tuning, termed Topological Soft Prompt Loss (TSLoss). TSLoss guides the model to learn structurally stable adaptations by quantifying inter-parameter connectivity and redundancy. Extensive experiments show that training with TSLoss accelerates convergence and improves tuning performance, providing an interpretable method to understand and optimize soft prompt tuning from structural and topological perspectives.]]></description>

Analytical diffusion models offer a mathematically transparent path to generative modeling by formulating the denoising score as an empirical-Bayes posterior mean. However, this interpretability comes at a prohibitive cost: the standard formulation necessitates a full-dataset scan at every timestep, scaling linearly with dataset size. In this work, we present the first systematic study addressing this scalability bottleneck. We challenge the prevailing assumption that the entire training data is necessary, uncovering the phenomenon of Posterior Progressive Concentration: the effective golden support of the denoising score is not static but shrinks asymptotically from the global manifold to a local neighborhood as the signal-to-noise ratio increases. Capitalizing on this, we propose Dynamic Time-Aware Golden Subset Diffusion (GoldDiff), a training-free framework that decouples inference complexity from dataset size. Instead of static retrieval, GoldDiff uses a coarse-to-fine mechanism to dynamically pinpoint the ''Golden Subset'' for inference. Theoretically, we derive rigorous bounds guaranteeing that our sparse approximation converges to the exact score. Empirically, GoldDiff achieves a $\bf 71 \times$ speedup on AFHQ while matching or achieving even better performance than full-scan baselines. Most notably, we demonstrate the first successful scaling of analytical diffusion to ImageNet-1K, unlocking a scalable, training-free paradigm for large-scale generative modeling.]]></description>

Object detection models are critical components of automated systems, such as autonomous vehicles and perception-based robots, but their sensitivity to adversarial attacks poses a serious security risk. Progress in defending these models lags behind classification, hindered by a lack of standardized evaluation. It is nearly impossible to thoroughly compare attack or defense methods, as existing work uses different datasets, inconsistent efficiency metrics, and varied measures of perturbation cost. This paper addresses this gap by investigating three key questions: (1) How can we create a fair benchmark to impartially compare attacks? (2) How well do modern attacks transfer across different architectures, especially from Convolutional Neural Networks to Vision Transformers? (3) What is the most effective adversarial training strategy for robust defense? To answer these, we first propose a unified benchmark framework focused on digital, non-patch-based attacks. This framework introduces specific metrics to disentangle localization and classification errors and evaluates attack cost using multiple perceptual metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art attacks and a wide range of detectors. Our findings reveal two major conclusions: first, modern adversarial attacks against object detection models show a significant lack of transferability to transformer-based architectures. Second, we demonstrate that the most robust adversarial training strategy leverages a dataset composed of a mix of high-perturbation attacks with different objectives (e.g., spatial and semantic), which outperforms training on any single attack.]]></description>

Looping, reusing a block of layers across depth, and depth growing, training shallow-to-deep models by duplicating middle layers, have both been linked to stronger reasoning, but their relationship remains unclear. We provide a mechanistic unification: looped and depth-grown models exhibit convergent depth-wise signatures, including increased reliance on late layers and recurring patterns aligned with the looped or grown block. These shared signatures support the view that their gains stem from a common form of iterative computation. Building on this connection, we show that the two techniques are adaptable and composable: applying inference-time looping to the middle blocks of a depth-grown model improves accuracy on some reasoning primitives by up to $2\times$, despite the model never being trained to loop. Both approaches also adapt better than the baseline when given more in-context examples or additional supervised fine-tuning data. Additionally, depth-grown models achieve the largest reasoning gains when using higher-quality, math-heavy cooldown mixtures, which can be further boosted by adapting a middle block to loop. Overall, our results position depth growth and looping as complementary, practical methods for inducing and scaling iterative computation to improve reasoning.]]></description>

Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to learn from corrective feedback within a conversational context. They are rarely proactive in soliciting this feedback, even when faced with ambiguity, which can make their dialogues feel static, one-sided, and lacking the adaptive qualities of human conversation. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from social meta-learning (SML) in humans - the process of learning how to learn from others. We formulate SML as a finetuning methodology, training LLMs to solicit and learn from language feedback in simulated pedagogical dialogues, where static tasks are converted into interactive social learning problems. SML effectively teaches models to use conversation to solve problems they are unable to solve in a single turn. This capability generalises across domains; SML on math problems produces models that better use feedback to solve coding problems and vice versa. Furthermore, despite being trained only on fully-specified problems, these models are better able to solve underspecified tasks where critical information is revealed over multiple turns. When faced with this ambiguity, SML-trained models make fewer premature answer attempts and are more likely to ask for the information they need. This work presents a scalable approach to developing AI systems that effectively learn from language feedback.]]></description>

Existing Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) typically rely on static, homogeneous model configurations, limiting their ability to exploit the distinct strengths of differently post-trained models. To address this, we introduce Team-of-Thoughts, a novel MAS architecture that leverages the complementary capabilities of heterogeneous agents via an orchestrator-tool paradigm. Our framework introduces two key mechanisms to optimize performance: (1) an orchestrator calibration scheme that identifies models with superior coordination capabilities, and (2) a self-assessment protocol where tool agents profile their own domain expertise to account for variations in post-training skills. During inference, the orchestrator dynamically activates the most suitable tool agents based on these proficiency profiles. Experiments on five reasoning and code generation benchmarks show that Team-of-Thoughts delivers consistently superior task performance. Notably, on AIME24 and LiveCodeBench, our approach achieves accuracies of 96.67% and 72.53%, respectively, substantially outperforming homogeneous role-play baselines, which score 80% and 65.93%.]]></description>

Causal discovery seeks to uncover causal relations from data, typically represented as causal graphs, and is essential for predicting the effects of interventions. While expert knowledge is required to construct principled causal graphs, many statistical methods have been proposed to leverage observational data with varying formal guarantees. Causal Assumption-based Argumentation (ABA) is a framework that uses symbolic reasoning to ensure correspondence between input constraints and output graphs, while offering a principled way to combine data and expertise. We explore the use of large language models (LLMs) as imperfect experts for Causal ABA, eliciting semantic structural priors from variable names and descriptions and integrating them with conditional-independence evidence. Experiments on standard benchmarks and semantically grounded synthetic graphs demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and we additionally introduce an evaluation protocol to mitigate memorisation bias when assessing LLMs for causal discovery.]]></description>

Estimating consumer preferences is central to many problems in economics and marketing. This paper develops a flexible framework for learning individual preferences from partial ranking information by interpreting observed rankings as collections of pairwise comparisons with logistic choice probabilities. We model latent utility as the sum of interpretable product attributes, item fixed effects, and a low-rank user-item factor structure, enabling both interpretability and information sharing across consumers and items. We further correct for selection in which comparisons are observed: a comparison is recorded only if both items enter the consumer's consideration set, inducing exposure bias toward frequently encountered items. We model pair observability as the product of item-level observability propensities and estimate these propensities with a logistic model for the marginal probability that an item is observable. Preference parameters are then estimated by maximizing an inverse-probability-weighted (IPW), ridge-regularized log-likelihood that reweights observed comparisons toward a target comparison population. To scale computation, we propose a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm based on inverse-probability resampling, which draws comparisons in proportion to their IPW weights. In an application to transaction data from an online wine retailer, the method improves out-of-sample recommendation performance relative to a popularity-based benchmark, with particularly strong gains in predicting purchases of previously unconsumed products.]]></description>

C-RASP is a simple programming language that was recently shown to capture concepts expressible by transformers. In this paper, we develop new algorithmic techniques for automatically verifying C-RASPs. To this end, we establish a connection to the verification of synchronous dataflow programs in Lustre, which enables us to exploit state-of-the-art model checkers utilizing highly optimized SMT-solvers. Our second contribution addresses learning a C-RASP program in the first place. To this end, we provide a new algorithm for learning a C-RASP from examples using local search. We demonstrate efficacy of our implementation for benchmarks of C-RASPs in the literature, in particular in connection to the following applications: (1) transformer program optimization, and (2) constrained learning of transformer programs (based on a partial specification).]]></description>

Machine-translated data is widely used in multilingual NLP, particularly when native text is scarce. However, translated text differs systematically from native text. This phenomenon is known as translationese, and it reflects both traces of the source language and characteristic properties of translation itself. In this paper, we study how training on machine-translated data affects small English language models, focusing on how translationese from different source languages shapes linguistic acceptability judgments and language modelling for different domains. We train models on English text translated from 24 typologically and resource-diverse source languages, enabling a systematic analysis of how source language and corpus properties influence what models learn. Our results show that the source language has a clear impact on model behavior: general perplexity is more driven by the lexical diversity of the translated corpus, while grammatical performance is strongly correlated to typological similarity to English, given enough data.]]></description>

In long-term multivariate time series forecasting, effectively capturing both periodic patterns and residual dynamics is essential. To address this within standard deep learning benchmark settings, we propose the Hierarchical Patching Mixer (HPMixer), which models periodicity and residuals in a decoupled yet complementary manner. The periodic component utilizes a learnable cycle module [7] enhanced with a nonlinear channel-wise MLP for greater expressiveness. The residual component is processed through a Learnable Stationary Wavelet Transform (LSWT) to extract stable, shift-invariant frequency-domain representations. Subsequently, a channel-mixing encoder models explicit inter-channel dependencies, while a two-level non-overlapping hierarchical patching mechanism captures coarse- and fine-scale residual variations. By integrating decoupled periodicity modeling with structured, multi-scale residual learning, HPMixer provides an effective framework. Extensive experiments on standard multivariate benchmarks demonstrate that HPMixer achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to recent baselines.]]></description>

The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) necessitates evaluation frameworks that reflect real-world academic rigor and multilingual complexity. This paper introduces IndicEval, a scalable benchmarking platform designed to assess LLM performance using authentic high-stakes examination questions from UPSC, JEE, and NEET across STEM and humanities domains in both English and Hindi. Unlike synthetic benchmarks, IndicEval grounds evaluation in real examination standards, enabling realistic measurement of reasoning, domain knowledge, and bilingual adaptability. The framework automates assessment using Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies and supports modular integration of new models and languages. Experiments conducted on Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4, Claude, and LLaMA 3-70B reveal three major findings. First, CoT prompting consistently improves reasoning accuracy, with substantial gains across subjects and languages. Second, significant cross-model performance disparities persist, particularly in high-complexity examinations. Third, multilingual degradation remains a critical challenge, with marked accuracy drops in Hindi compared to English, especially under Zero-Shot conditions. These results highlight persistent gaps in bilingual reasoning and domain transfer. Overall, IndicEval provides a practice-oriented, extensible foundation for rigorous, equitable evaluation of LLMs in multilingual educational settings and offers actionable insights for improving reasoning robustness and language adaptability.]]></description>

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tunes large models by learning low-rank updates on top of frozen weights, dramatically reducing trainable parameters and memory. In this work, we address the gap between training with full steps with low-rank projections (SVDLoRA) and LoRA fine-tuning. We propose LoRSum, a memory-efficient subroutine that closes this gap for gradient descent by casting LoRA optimization as a proximal sub-problem and solving it efficiently with alternating least squares updates, which we prove to be an implicit block power method. We recover several recently proposed preconditioning methods for LoRA as special cases, and show that LoRSum can also be used for updating a low-rank momentum. In order to address full steps with preconditioned gradient descent, we propose a scaled variant of LoRSum that uses structured metrics such as K-FAC and Shampoo, and we show that storing the diagonal of these metrics still allows them to perform well while remaining memory-efficient. Experiments on a synthetic task, CIFAR-100, and language-model fine-tuning on GLUE, SQuAD v2, and WikiText-103, show that our method can match or improve LoRA baselines given modest compute overhead, while avoiding full-matrix SVD projections and retaining LoRA-style parameter efficiency.]]></description>

While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for reasoning and self-correction at the textual level, these strengths provide minimal benefits for complex tasks centered on visual perception, such as Chart Parsing. Existing models often struggle with visually dense charts, leading to errors like data omission, misalignment, and hallucination. Inspired by the human strategy of using a finger as a ``visual anchor'' to ensure accuracy when reading complex charts, we propose a new paradigm named Visual Self-Refine (VSR). The core idea of VSR is to enable a model to generate pixel-level localization outputs, visualize them, and then feed these visualizations back to itself, allowing it to intuitively inspect and correct its own potential visual perception errors. We instantiate the VSR paradigm in the domain of Chart Parsing by proposing ChartVSR. This model decomposes the parsing process into two stages: a Refine Stage, where it iteratively uses visual feedback to ensure the accuracy of all data points' Pixel-level Localizations, and a Decode Stage, where it uses these verified localizations as precise visual anchors to parse the final structured data. To address the limitations of existing benchmarks, we also construct ChartP-Bench, a new and highly challenging benchmark for chart parsing. Our work also highlights VSR as a general-purpose visual feedback mechanism, offering a promising new direction for enhancing accuracy on a wide range of vision-centric tasks.]]></description>

Generative model evaluation commonly relies on high-dimensional embedding spaces to compute distances between samples. We show that dataset representations in these spaces are affected by the hubness phenomenon, which distorts nearest neighbor relationships and biases distance-based metrics. Building on the classical Iterative Contextual Dissimilarity Measure (ICDM), we introduce Generative ICDM (GICDM), a method to correct neighborhood estimation for both real and generated data. We introduce a multi-scale extension to improve empirical behavior. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real benchmarks demonstrate that GICDM resolves hubness-induced failures, restores reliable metric behavior, and improves alignment with human judgment.]]></description>

The pursuit of general-purpose robotic manipulation is hindered by the scarcity of diverse, real-world interaction data. Unlike data collection from web in vision or language, robotic data collection is an active process incurring prohibitive physical costs. Consequently, automated task curation to maximize data value remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. Existing manual methods are unscalable and biased toward common tasks, while off-the-shelf foundation models often hallucinate physically infeasible instructions. To address this, we introduce RoboGene, an agentic framework designed to automate the generation of diverse, physically plausible manipulation tasks across single-arm, dual-arm, and mobile robots. RoboGene integrates three core components: diversity-driven sampling for broad task coverage, self-reflection mechanisms to enforce physical constraints, and human-in-the-loop refinement for continuous improvement. We conduct extensive quantitative analysis and large-scale real-world experiments, collecting datasets of 18k trajectories and introducing novel metrics to assess task quality, feasibility, and diversity. Results demonstrate that RoboGene significantly outperforms state-of-the-art foundation models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro). Furthermore, real-world experiments show that VLA models pre-trained with RoboGene achieve higher success rates and superior generalization, underscoring the importance of high-quality task generation.

As the volume of data recorded by embedded edge sensors increases, particularly from neuromorphic devices producing discrete event streams, there is a growing need for hardware-aware neural architectures that enable efficient, low-latency, and energy-conscious local processing. We present an FPGA implementation of event-graph neural networks for audio processing. We utilise an artificial cochlea that converts time-series signals into sparse event data, reducing memory and computation costs. Our architecture was implemented on a SoC FPGA and evaluated on two open-source datasets. For classification task, our baseline floating-point model achieves 92.7% accuracy on SHD dataset - only 2.4% below the state of the art - while requiring over 10x and 67x fewer parameters. On SSC, our models achieve 66.9-71.0% accuracy. Compared to FPGA-based spiking neural networks, our quantised model reaches 92.3% accuracy, outperforming them by up to 19.3% while reducing resource usage and latency. For SSC, we report the first hardware-accelerated evaluation. We further demonstrate the first end-to-end FPGA implementation of event-audio keyword spotting, combining graph convolutional layers with recurrent sequence modelling. The system achieves up to 95% word-end detection accuracy, with only 10.53 microsecond latency and 1.18 W power consumption, establishing a strong benchmark for energy-efficient event-driven KWS.]]></description>

Conventional large language model (LLM) fairness alignment largely focuses on mitigating bias along single sensitive attributes, overlooking fairness as an inherently multidimensional and context-specific value. This approach risks creating systems that achieve narrow fairness metrics while exacerbating disparities along untargeted attributes, a phenomenon known as bias spillover. While extensively studied in machine learning, bias spillover remains critically underexplored in LLM alignment. In this work, we investigate how targeted gender alignment affects fairness across nine sensitive attributes in three state-of-the-art LLMs (Mistral 7B, Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B). Using Direct Preference Optimization and the BBQ benchmark, we evaluate fairness under ambiguous and disambiguous contexts. Our findings reveal noticeable bias spillover: while aggregate results show improvements, context-aware analysis exposes significant degradations in ambiguous contexts, particularly for physical appearance ($p< 0.001$ across all models), sexual orientation, and disability status. We demonstrate that improving fairness along one attribute can inadvertently worsen disparities in others under uncertainty, highlighting the necessity of context-aware, multi-attribute fairness evaluation frameworks.]]></description>

Releasing data once and for all under noninteractive Local Differential Privacy (LDP) enables complete data reusability, but the resulting noise may create bias in subsequent analyses. In this work, we leverage the Weierstrass transform to characterize this bias in binary classification. We prove that inverting this transform leads to a bias-correction method to compute unbiased estimates of nonlinear functions on examples released under LDP. We then build a novel stochastic gradient descent algorithm called Inverse Weierstrass Private SGD (IWP-SGD). It converges to the true population risk minimizer at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$, with $n$ the number of examples. We empirically validate IWP-SGD on binary classification tasks using synthetic and real-world datasets.]]></description>

Automated feature engineering (AFE) enables AI systems to autonomously construct high-utility representations from raw tabular data. However, existing AFE methods rely on statistical heuristics, yielding brittle features that fail under distribution shift. We introduce CAFE, a framework that reformulates AFE as a causally-guided sequential decision process, bridging causal discovery with reinforcement learning-driven feature construction. Phase I learns a sparse directed acyclic graph over features and the target to obtain soft causal priors, grouping features as direct, indirect, or other based on their causal influence with respect to the target. Phase II uses a cascading multi-agent deep Q-learning architecture to select causal groups and transformation operators, with hierarchical reward shaping and causal group-level exploration strategies that favor causally plausible transformations while controlling feature complexity. Across 15 public benchmarks (classification with macro-F1; regression with inverse relative absolute error), CAFE achieves up to 7% improvement over strong AFE baselines, reduces episodes-to-convergence, and delivers competitive time-to-target. Under controlled covariate shifts, CAFE reduces performance drop by ~4x relative to a non-causal multi-agent baseline, and produces more compact feature sets with more stable post-hoc attributions. These findings underscore that causal structure, used as a soft inductive prior rather than a rigid constraint, can substantially improve the robustness and efficiency of automated feature engineering.]]></description>

Designing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems for India requires balancing linguistic diversity, document heterogeneity, and deployment constraints. In this paper, we study two training strategies for building multilingual OCR systems with Vision-Language Models through the Chitrapathak series. We first follow a popular multimodal approach, pairing a generic vision encoder with a strong multilingual language model and training the system end-to-end for OCR. Alternatively, we explore fine-tuning an existing OCR model, despite not being trained for the target languages. Through extensive evaluation on multilingual Indic OCR benchmarks and deployment-oriented metrics, we find that the second strategy consistently achieves better accuracy-latency trade-offs. Chitrapathak-2 achieves 3-6x speedup over its predecessor with being state-of-the-art (SOTA) in Telugu (6.69 char ANLS) and second best in the rest. In addition, we present Parichay, an independent OCR model series designed specifically for 9 Indian government documents to extract structured key fields, achieving 89.8% Exact Match score with a faster inference. Together, these systems achieve SOTA performance and provide practical guidance for building production-scale OCR pipelines in the Indian context.]]></description>

Agentic systems, AI architectures that autonomously execute multi-step workflows to achieve complex goals, are often built using repeated large language model (LLM) calls for closed-set decision tasks such as routing, shortlisting, gating, and verification. While convenient, this design makes deployments slow and expensive due to cumulative latency and token usage. We propose TabAgent, a framework for replacing generative decision components in closed-set selection tasks with a compact textual-tabular classifier trained on execution traces. TabAgent (i) extracts structured schema, state, and dependency features from trajectories (TabSchema), (ii) augments coverage with schema-aligned synthetic supervision (TabSynth), and (iii) scores candidates with a lightweight classifier (TabHead). On the long-horizon AppWorld benchmark, TabAgent maintains task-level success while eliminating shortlist-time LLM calls, reducing latency by approximately 95% and inference cost by 85-91%. Beyond tool shortlisting, TabAgent generalizes to other agentic decision heads, establishing a paradigm for learned discriminative replacements of generative bottlenecks in production agent architectures.]]></description>

Multiagent AI systems require consistent communication, but we lack methods to verify that agents share the same understanding of the terms used. Natural language is interpretable but vulnerable to semantic drift, while learned protocols are efficient but opaque. We propose a certification protocol based on the stimulus-meaning model, where agents are tested on shared observable events and terms are certified if empirical disagreement falls below a statistical threshold. In this protocol, agents restricting their reasoning to certified terms ("core-guarded reasoning") achieve provably bounded disagreement. We also outline mechanisms for detecting drift (recertification) and recovering shared vocabulary (renegotiation). In simulations with varying degrees of semantic divergence, core-guarding reduces disagreement by 72-96%. In a validation with fine-tuned language models, disagreement is reduced by 51%. Our framework provides a first step towards verifiable agent-to-agent communication.]]></description>

Generating diagnostic text from histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) is challenging due to the gigapixel scale of the input and the requirement for precise, domain specific language. We propose a hierarchical vision language framework that combines a frozen pathology foundation model with a Transformer decoder for report generation. To make WSI processing tractable, we perform multi resolution pyramidal patch selection (downsampling factors 2^3 to 2^6) and remove background and artifacts using Laplacian variance and HSV based criteria. Patch features are extracted with the UNI Vision Transformer and projected to a 6 layer Transformer decoder that generates diagnostic text via cross attention. To better represent biomedical terminology, we tokenize the output using BioGPT. Finally, we add a retrieval based verification step that compares generated reports with a reference corpus using Sentence BERT embeddings; if a high similarity match is found, the generated report is replaced with the retrieved ground truth reference to improve reliability.]]></description>

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable success across a wide range of tasks, long-form video understanding remains a significant challenge. In this study, we focus on video understanding by MLLMs. This task is challenging because processing a full stream of RGB frames is computationally intractable and highly redundant, as self-attention have quadratic complexity with sequence length. In this paper, we propose ReMoRa, a video MLLM that processes videos by operating directly on their compressed representations. A sparse set of RGB keyframes is retained for appearance, while temporal dynamics are encoded as a motion representation, removing the need for sequential RGB frames. These motion representations act as a compact proxy for optical flow, capturing temporal dynamics without full frame decoding. To refine the noise and low fidelity of block-based motions, we introduce a module to denoise and generate a fine-grained motion representation. Furthermore, our model compresses these features in a way that scales linearly with sequence length. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ReMoRa through extensive experiments across a comprehensive suite of long-video understanding benchmarks. ReMoRa outperformed baseline methods on multiple challenging benchmarks, including LongVideoBench, NExT-QA, and MLVU.]]></description>

Evaluating machine unlearning methods remains technically challenging, with recent benchmarks requiring complex setups and significant engineering overhead. We introduce a unified and extensible benchmarking suite that simplifies the evaluation of unlearning algorithms using the KLoM (KL divergence of Margins) metric. Our framework provides precomputed model ensembles, oracle outputs, and streamlined infrastructure for running evaluations out of the box. By standardizing setup and metrics, it enables reproducible, scalable, and fair comparison across unlearning methods. We aim for this benchmark to serve as a practical foundation for accelerating research and promoting best practices in machine unlearning. Our code and data are publicly available.]]></description>

Replay attacks remain a critical vulnerability for automatic speaker verification systems, particularly in real-time voice assistant applications. In this work, we propose acoustic maps as a novel spatial feature representation for replay speech detection from multi-channel recordings. Derived from classical beamforming over discrete azimuth and elevation grids, acoustic maps encode directional energy distributions that reflect physical differences between human speech radiation and loudspeaker-based replay. A lightweight convolutional neural network is designed to operate on this representation, achieving competitive performance on the ReMASC dataset with approximately 6k trainable parameters. Experimental results show that acoustic maps provide a compact and physically interpretable feature space for replay attack detection across different devices and acoustic environments.]]></description>

In indoor assistive perception for visually impaired users, 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is expected to provide structurally coherent and semantically consistent occupancy under strictly monocular vision for safety-critical scene understanding. However, existing monocular SSC approaches often lack explicit modeling of voxel-feature reliability and regulated cross-scale information propagation during 2D-3D projection and multi-scale fusion, making them vulnerable to projection diffusion and feature entanglement and thus limiting structural stability.To address these challenges, this paper presents an Adaptive Multi-scale Attention Aggregation (AMAA) framework built upon the MonoScene pipeline. Rather than introducing a heavier backbone, AMAA focuses on reliability-oriented feature regulation within a monocular SSC framework. Specifically, lifted voxel features are jointly calibrated in semantic and spatial dimensions through parallel channel-spatial attention aggregation, while multi-scale encoder-decoder fusion is stabilized via a hierarchical adaptive feature-gating strategy that regulates information injection across scales.Experiments on the NYUv2 benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements over MonoScene without significantly increasing system complexity: AMAA achieves 27.25% SSC mIoU (+0.31) and 43.10% SC IoU (+0.59). In addition, system-level deployment on an NVIDIA Jetson platform verifies that the complete AMAA framework can be executed stably on embedded hardware. Overall, AMAA improves monocular SSC quality and provides a reliable and deployable perception framework for indoor assistive systems targeting visually impaired users.]]></description>

We propose an agentic data augmentation method for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) that uses iterative generation and verification to produce high quality synthetic training examples. To isolate the effect of agentic structure, we also develop a closely matched prompting-based baseline using the same model and instructions. Both methods are evaluated across three ABSA subtasks (Aspect Term Extraction (ATE), Aspect Sentiment Classification (ATSC), and Aspect Sentiment Pair Extraction (ASPE)), four SemEval datasets, and two encoder-decoder models: T5-Base and Tk-Instruct. Our results show that the agentic augmentation outperforms raw prompting in label preservation of the augmented data, especially when the tasks require aspect term generation. In addition, when combined with real data, agentic augmentation provides higher gains, consistently outperforming prompting-based generation. These benefits are most pronounced for T5-Base, while the more heavily pretrained Tk-Instruct exhibits smaller improvements. As a result, augmented data helps T5-Base achieve comparable performance with its counterpart.]]></description>

Generative models are increasingly used in recommender systems, both for modeling user behavior as event sequences and for integrating large language models into recommendation pipelines. A key challenge in this setting is the extremely large cardinality of item spaces, which makes training generative models difficult and introduces a vocabulary gap between natural language and item identifiers. Semantic identifiers (semantic IDs), which represent items as sequences of low-cardinality tokens, have recently emerged as an effective solution to this problem.
  However, existing approaches generate semantic identifiers of fixed length, assigning the same description length to all items. This is inefficient, misaligned with natural language, and ignores the highly skewed frequency structure of real-world catalogs, where popular items and rare long-tail items exhibit fundamentally different information requirements. In parallel, the emergent communication literature studies how agents develop discrete communication protocols, often producing variable-length messages in which frequent concepts receive shorter descriptions. Despite the conceptual similarity, these ideas have not been systematically adopted in recommender systems.
  In this work, we bridge recommender systems and emergent communication by introducing variable-length semantic identifiers for recommendation. We propose a discrete variational autoencoder with Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization that learns item representations of adaptive length under a principled probabilistic framework, avoiding the instability of REINFORCE-based training and the fixed-length constraints of prior semantic ID methods.]]></description>

Artificial intelligence can rapidly propose candidate phases and structures from X-ray diffraction (XRD), but these hypotheses often fail in downstream refinement because peak intensities cannot be stably assigned under severe overlap and diffraction consistency is enforced only weakly. Here we introduce WPEM, a physics-constrained whole-pattern decomposition and refinement workflow that turns Bragg's law into an explicit constraint within a batch expectation--maximization framework. WPEM models the full profile as a probabilistic mixture density and iteratively infers component-resolved intensities while keeping peak centres Bragg-consistent, producing a continuous, physically admissible intensity representation that remains stable in heavily overlapped regions and in the presence of mixed radiation or multiple phases. We benchmark WPEM on standard reference patterns (\ce{PbSO4} and \ce{Tb2BaCoO5}), where it yields lower $R_{\mathrm{p}}$/$R_{\mathrm{wp}}$ than widely used packages (FullProf and TOPAS) under matched refinement conditions. We further demonstrate generality across realistic experimental scenarios, including phase-resolved decomposition of a multiphase Ti--15Nb thin film, quantitative recovery of \ce{NaCl}--\ce{Li2CO3} mixture compositions, separation of crystalline peaks from amorphous halos in semicrystalline polymers, high-throughput operando lattice tracking in layered cathodes, automated refinement of a compositionally disordered Ru--Mn oxide solid solution (CCDC 2530452), and quantitative phase-resolved deciphering of an ancient Egyptian make-up sample from synchrotron powder XRD. By providing Bragg-consistent, uncertainty-aware intensity partitioning as a refinement-ready interface, WPEM closes the gap between AI-generated hypotheses and diffraction-admissible structure refinement on challenging XRD data.]]></description>

Continuum manipulators in flexible endoscopic surgical systems offer high dexterity for minimally invasive procedures; however, accurate pose estimation and closed-loop control remain challenging due to hysteresis, compliance, and limited distal sensing. Vision-based approaches reduce hardware complexity but are often constrained by limited geometric observability and high computational overhead, restricting real-time closed-loop applicability. This paper presents a unified framework for markerless stereo 6D pose estimation and position-based visual servoing of continuum manipulators. A photo-realistic simulation pipeline enables large-scale automatic training with pixel-accurate annotations. A stereo-aware multi-feature fusion network jointly exploits segmentation masks, keypoints, heatmaps, and bounding boxes to enhance geometric observability. To enforce geometric consistency without iterative optimization, a feed-forward rendering-based refinement module predicts residual pose corrections in a single pass. A self-supervised sim-to-real adaptation strategy further improves real-world performance using unlabeled data. Extensive real-world validation achieves a mean translation error of 0.83 mm and a mean rotation error of 2.76° across 1,000 samples. Markerless closed-loop visual servoing driven by the estimated pose attains accurate trajectory tracking with a mean translation error of 2.07 mm and a mean rotation error of 7.41°, corresponding to 85% and 59% reductions compared to open-loop control, together with high repeatability in repeated point-reaching tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first fully markerless pose-estimation-driven position-based visual servoing framework for continuum manipulators, enabling precise closed-loop control without physical markers or embedded sensing.]]></description>

We study reward-free and reward-agnostic exploration in episodic finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs), where an agent explores an unknown environment without observing external rewards. Reward-free exploration aims to enable $ε$-optimal policies for any reward revealed after exploration, while reward-agnostic exploration targets $ε$-optimality for rewards drawn from a small finite class. In the reward-agnostic setting, Li, Yan, Chen, and Fan achieve minimax sample complexity, but only for restrictively small accuracy parameter $ε$. We propose a new algorithm that significantly relaxes the requirement on $ε$. Our approach is novel and of technical interest by itself. Our algorithm employs an online learning procedure with carefully designed rewards to construct an exploration policy, which is used to gather data sufficient for accurate dynamics estimation and subsequent computation of an $ε$-optimal policy once the reward is revealed. Finally, we establish a tight lower bound for reward-free exploration, closing the gap between known upper and lower bounds.]]></description>

Accurate estimation of the relative concentrations of chromophores in a spectroscopic photoacoustic (sPA) image can reveal immense structural, functional, and molecular information about physiological processes. However, due to nonlinearities and ill-posedness inherent to sPA imaging, concentration estimation is intractable. The Spectroscopic Photoacoustic Optical Inversion Autoencoder (SPOI-AE) aims to address the sPA optical inversion and spectral unmixing problems without assuming linearity. Herein, SPOI-AE was trained and tested on \textit{in vivo} mouse lymph node sPA images with unknown ground truth chromophore concentrations. SPOI-AE better reconstructs input sPA pixels than conventional algorithms while providing biologically coherent estimates for optical parameters, chromophore concentrations, and the percent oxygen saturation of tissue. SPOI-AE's unmixing accuracy was validated using a simulated mouse lymph node phantom ground truth.]]></description>

Semantics has enabled 3D scene understanding and affordance-driven object interaction. However, robots operating in real-world environments face a critical limitation: they cannot anticipate how objects move. Long-horizon mobile manipulation requires closing the gap between semantics, geometry, and kinematics. In this work, we present MoMa-SG, a novel framework for building semantic-kinematic 3D scene graphs of articulated scenes containing a myriad of interactable objects. Given RGB-D sequences containing multiple object articulations, we temporally segment object interactions and infer object motion using occlusion-robust point tracking. We then lift point trajectories into 3D and estimate articulation models using a novel unified twist estimation formulation that robustly estimates revolute and prismatic joint parameters in a single optimization pass. Next, we associate objects with estimated articulations and detect contained objects by reasoning over parent-child relations at identified opening states. We also introduce the novel Arti4D-Semantic dataset, which uniquely combines hierarchical object semantics including parent-child relation labels with object axis annotations across 62 in-the-wild RGB-D sequences containing 600 object interactions and three distinct observation paradigms. We extensively evaluate the performance of MoMa-SG on two datasets and ablate key design choices of our approach. In addition, real-world experiments on both a quadruped and a mobile manipulator demonstrate that our semantic-kinematic scene graphs enable robust manipulation of articulated objects in everyday home environments. We provide code and data at: https://momasg.cs.uni-freiburg.de.]]></description>

In the age of digital epidemiology, epidemiologists are faced by an increasing amount of data of growing complexity and dimensionality. Machine learning is a set of powerful tools that can help to analyze such enormous amounts of data. This chapter lays the methodological foundations for successfully applying machine learning in epidemiology. It covers the principles of supervised and unsupervised learning and discusses the most important machine learning methods. Strategies for model evaluation and hyperparameter optimization are developed and interpretable machine learning is introduced. All these theoretical parts are accompanied by code examples in R, where an example dataset on heart disease is used throughout the chapter.]]></description>

We introduce SCAR, a method for long-term auto-calibration refinement of aerial visual-inertial systems that exploits georeferenced satellite imagery as a persistent global reference. SCAR estimates both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters by aligning aerial images with 2D--3D correspondences derived from publicly available orthophotos and elevation models. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on dedicated calibration maneuvers or manually surveyed ground control points, our method leverages external geospatial data to detect and correct calibration degradation under field deployment conditions. We evaluate our approach on six large-scale aerial campaigns conducted over two years under diverse seasonal and environmental conditions. Across all sequences, SCAR consistently outperforms established baselines (Kalibr, COLMAP, VINS-Mono), reducing median reprojection error by a large margin, and translating these calibration gains into substantially lower visual localization rotation errors and higher pose accuracy. These results demonstrate that SCAR provides accurate, robust, and reproducible calibration over long-term aerial operations without the need for manual intervention.]]></description>

LLM-based agents execute real-world workflows via tools and memory. These affordances enable ill-intended adversaries to also use these agents to carry out complex misuse scenarios. Existing agent misuse benchmarks largely test single-prompt instructions, leaving a gap in measuring how agents end up helping with harmful or illegal tasks over multiple turns. We introduce STING (Sequential Testing of Illicit N-step Goal execution), an automated red-teaming framework that constructs a step-by-step illicit plan grounded in a benign persona and iteratively probes a target agent with adaptive follow-ups, using judge agents to track phase completion. We further introduce an analysis framework that models multi-turn red-teaming as a time-to-first-jailbreak random variable, enabling analysis tools like discovery curves, hazard-ratio attribution by attack language, and a new metric: Restricted Mean Jailbreak Discovery. Across AgentHarm scenarios, STING yields substantially higher illicit-task completion than single-turn prompting and chat-oriented multi-turn baselines adapted to tool-using agents. In multilingual evaluations across six non-English settings, we find that attack success and illicit-task completion do not consistently increase in lower-resource languages, diverging from common chatbot findings. Overall, STING provides a practical way to evaluate and stress-test agent misuse in realistic deployment settings, where interactions are inherently multi-turn and often multilingual.]]></description>

Since Text-to-Speech systems typically don't produce waveforms directly, recent spoof detection studies use resynthesized waveforms from vocoders and neural audio codecs to simulate an attacker. Unlike vocoders, which are specifically designed for speech synthesis, neural audio codecs were originally developed for compressing audio for storage and transmission. However, their ability to discretize speech also sparked interest in language-modeling-based speech synthesis. Owing to this dual functionality, codec resynthesized data may be labeled as either bonafide or spoof. So far, very little research has addressed this issue. In this study, we present a challenging extension of the ASVspoof 5 dataset constructed for this purpose. We examine how different labeling choices affect detection performance and provide insights into labeling strategies.]]></description>

In this work, we apply and compare two state-of-the-art eXplainability Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, the Integrated Gradients (IG) and the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), that explain the fault diagnosis decisions of a highly accurate Long Short-Time Memory (LSTM) classifier. The classifier is trained to detect faults in a benchmark non-linear chemical process, the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP). It is highlighted how XAI methods can help identify the subsystem of the process where the fault occurred. Using our knowledge of the process, we note that in most cases the same features are indicated as the most important for the decision, while insome cases the SHAP method seems to be more informative and closer to the root cause of the fault. Finally, since the used XAI methods are model-agnostic, the proposed approach is not limited to the specific process and can also be used in similar problems.]]></description>

We study the implicit bias of momentum-based optimizers on homogeneous models. We first extend existing results on the implicit bias of steepest descent in homogeneous models to normalized steepest descent with an optional learning rate schedule. We then show that for smooth homogeneous models, momentum steepest descent algorithms like Muon (spectral norm), MomentumGD ($\ell_2$ norm), and Signum ($\ell_\infty$ norm) are approximate steepest descent trajectories under a decaying learning rate schedule, proving that these algorithms too have a bias towards KKT points of the corresponding margin maximization problem. We extend the analysis to Adam (without the stability constant), which maximizes the $\ell_\infty$ margin, and to Muon-Signum and Muon-Adam, which maximize a hybrid norm. Our experiments corroborate the theory and show that the identity of the margin maximized depends on the choice of optimizer. Overall, our results extend earlier lines of work on steepest descent in homogeneous models and momentum-based optimizers in linear models.]]></description>

We propose the Subtractive Modulative Network (SMN), a novel, parameter-efficient Implicit Neural Representation (INR) architecture inspired by classical subtractive synthesis. The SMN is designed as a principled signal processing pipeline, featuring a learnable periodic activation layer (Oscillator) that generates a multi-frequency basis, and a series of modulative mask modules (Filters) that actively generate high-order harmonics. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical validation for our design. Our SMN achieves a PSNR of $40+$ dB on two image datasets, comparing favorably against state-of-the-art methods in terms of both reconstruction accuracy and parameter efficiency. Furthermore, consistent advantage is observed on the challenging 3D NeRF novel view synthesis task. Supplementary materials are available at https://inrainbws.github.io/smn/.]]></description>

This work presents HAWX, a hardware-aware scalable exploration framework that employs multi-level sensitivity scoring at different DNN abstraction levels (operator, filter, layer, and model) to guide selective integration of heterogeneous AxC blocks. Supported by predictive models for accuracy, power, and area, HAWX accelerates the evaluation of candidate configurations, achieving over 23* speedup in a layer-level search with two candidate approximate blocks and more than (3*106)* speedup at the filter-level search only for LeNet-5, while maintaining accuracy comparable to exhaustive search. Experiments across state-of-the-art DNN benchmarks such as VGG-11, ResNet-18, and EfficientNetLite demonstrate that the efficiency benefits of HAWX scale exponentially with network size. The HAWX hardware-aware search algorithm supports both spatial and temporal accelerator architectures, leveraging either off-the-shelf approximate components or customized designs.]]></description>

Spatial audio understanding aims to enable machines to interpret complex auditory scenes, particularly when sound sources move over time. In this work, we study Spatial Audio Question Answering (Spatial AQA) with a focus on movement reasoning, where a model must infer object motion, position, and directional changes directly from stereo audio. First, we introduce a movement-centric spatial audio augmentation framework that synthesizes diverse motion patterns from isolated mono audio events, enabling controlled and scalable training data generation. Second, we propose an end-to-end multimodal finetuning approach with a thinking mode, which allows audio-language models to produce explicit intermediate reasoning steps before predicting an answer. Third, we investigate the impact of query-conditioned source separation as a preprocessing stage and compare three inference regimes: no masking, an audio grounding model (AGM), and ground-truth masks. Our results show that reasoning amplifies the benefits of source separation, with thinking mode showing significant improvement of +5.1% when a single event is present in the question. These findings highlight the interplay between movement modeling, reasoning, and separation quality, offering new insights for advancing spatial audio understanding.]]></description>

With the introduction of cyber-physical genome sequencing and editing technologies, such as CRISPR, researchers can more easily access tools to investigate and create remedies for a variety of topics in genetics and health science (e.g. agriculture and medicine). As the field advances and grows, new concerns present themselves in the ability to predict the off-target behavior. In this work, we explore the underlying biological and chemical model from a data driven perspective. Additionally, we present a machine learning based solution named \textit{Guide-Guard} to predict the behavior of the system given a gRNA in the CRISPR gene-editing process with 84\% accuracy. This solution is able to be trained on multiple different genes at the same time while retaining accuracy.]]></description>

In the fast-evolving field of artificial intelligence, where models are increasingly growing in complexity and size, the availability of labeled data for training deep learning models has become a significant challenge. Addressing complex problems like object detection demands considerable time and resources for data labeling to achieve meaningful results. For companies developing such applications, this entails extensive investment in highly skilled personnel or costly outsourcing. This research work aims to demonstrate that enhancing feature extractors can substantially alleviate this challenge, enabling models to learn more effective representations with less labeled data. Utilizing a self-supervised learning strategy, we present a model trained on unlabeled data that outperforms state-of-the-art feature extractors pre-trained on ImageNet and particularly designed for object detection tasks. Moreover, the results demonstrate that our approach encourages the model to focus on the most relevant aspects of an object, thus achieving better feature representations and, therefore, reinforcing its reliability and robustness.]]></description>

Multi-objective optimisation using BRIGHT has proven insightful and effective in prostate cancer brachytherapy treatment planning. BRachytherapy via artificially Intelligent GOMEA-Heuristic based Treatment planning (BRIGHT) generates multiple treatment plans, each with a different trade-off between tumour coverage and organs-at-risk sparing. BRIGHT was recently extended to cervical cancer brachytherapy. In this study, we present a novel, custom-developed graphical user interface (GUI) that enables plan navigation, pairwise comparisons, dose distribution visualisation, and possibility for adjustments - essential for efficient clinical use of BRIGHT. End-user validation of BRIGHT with the dedicated GUI was conducted for cervical cancer brachytherapy by emulating clinical practice in ten previously treated patients. A multidisciplinary brachytherapy team used BRIGHT to create new treatment plans. GUI usability was assessed using the System Usability Scale (SUS). BRIGHT plan quality was compared to clinical practice via blinded one-on-one comparisons. The GUI offered helpful features for plan navigation and evaluation, giving users quick insight into whether planning aims are achievable and what treatment options are available. The overall SUS score was 83.3, indicating an 'excellent' system. BRIGHT outperformed clinical practice in five out of ten patients regarding the coverage-sparing trade-off and performed equally well in the remaining five. The BRIGHT plan was preferred over the clinical plan in eight out of ten patients, four of which showed clinically relevant differences. The clinical plan was preferred in two patients, neither with clinically relevant differences. In conclusion, BRIGHT, with its dedicated GUI, is a clinically viable and user-friendly tool for treatment planning in cervical cancer brachytherapy.]]></description>

Accurate and computationally efficient 3D medical image segmentation remains a critical challenge in clinical workflows. Transformer-based architectures often demonstrate superior global contextual modeling but at the expense of excessive parameter counts and memory demands, restricting their clinical deployment. We propose RefineFormer3D, a lightweight hierarchical transformer architecture that balances segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency for volumetric medical imaging. The architecture integrates three key components: (i) GhostConv3D-based patch embedding for efficient feature extraction with minimal redundancy, (ii) MixFFN3D module with low-rank projections and depthwise convolutions for parameter-efficient feature extraction, and (iii) a cross-attention fusion decoder enabling adaptive multi-scale skip connection integration. RefineFormer3D contains only 2.94M parameters, substantially fewer than contemporary transformer-based methods. Extensive experiments on ACDC and BraTS benchmarks demonstrate that RefineFormer3D achieves 93.44\% and 85.9\% average Dice scores respectively, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art methods while requiring significantly fewer parameters. Furthermore, the model achieves fast inference (8.35 ms per volume on GPU) with low memory requirements, supporting deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. These results establish RefineFormer3D as an effective and scalable solution for practical 3D medical image segmentation.]]></description>

Weight-space models learn directly from the parameters of neural networks, enabling tasks such as predicting their accuracy on new datasets. Naive methods -- like applying MLPs to flattened parameters -- perform poorly, making the design of better weight-space architectures a central challenge. While prior work leveraged permutation symmetries in standard networks to guide such designs, no analogous analysis or tailored architecture yet exists for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). In this work, we show that KANs share the same permutation symmetries as MLPs, and propose the KAN-graph, a graph representation of their computation. Building on this, we develop WS-KAN, the first weight-space architecture that learns on KANs, which naturally accounts for their symmetry. We analyze WS-KAN's expressive power, showing it can replicate an input KAN's forward pass - a standard approach for assessing expressiveness in weight-space architectures. We construct a comprehensive ``zoo'' of trained KANs spanning diverse tasks, which we use as benchmarks to empirically evaluate WS-KAN. Across all tasks, WS-KAN consistently outperforms structure-agnostic baselines, often by a substantial margin. Our code is available at https://github.com/BarSGuy/KAN-Graph-Metanetwork.]]></description>

Recommender systems shape individual choices through feedback loops in which user behavior and algorithmic recommendations coevolve over time. The systemic effects of these loops remain poorly understood, in part due to unrealistic assumptions in existing simulation studies. We propose a feedback-loop model that captures implicit feedback, periodic retraining, probabilistic adoption of recommendations, and heterogeneous recommender systems. We apply the framework on online retail and music streaming data and analyze systemic effects of the feedback loop. We find that increasing recommender adoption may lead to a progressive diversification of individual consumption, while collective demand is redistributed in model- and domain-dependent ways, often amplifying popularity concentration. Temporal analyses further reveal that apparent increases in individual diversity observed in static evaluations are illusory: when adoption is fixed and time unfolds, individual diversity consistently decreases across all models. Our results highlight the need to move beyond static evaluations and explicitly account for feedback-loop dynamics when designing recommender systems.]]></description>

Existing evaluations of agents with memory typically assess memorization and action in isolation. One class of benchmarks evaluates memorization by testing recall of past conversations or text but fails to capture how memory is used to guide future decisions. Another class focuses on agents acting in single-session tasks without the need for long-term memory. However, in realistic settings, memorization and action are tightly coupled: agents acquire memory while interacting with the environment, and subsequently rely on that memory to solve future tasks. To capture this setting, we introduce MemoryArena, a unified evaluation gym for benchmarking agent memory in multi-session Memory-Agent-Environment loops. The benchmark consists of human-crafted agentic tasks with explicitly interdependent subtasks, where agents must learn from earlier actions and feedback by distilling experiences into memory, and subsequently use that memory to guide later actions to solve the overall task. MemoryArena supports evaluation across web navigation, preference-constrained planning, progressive information search, and sequential formal reasoning, and reveals that agents with near-saturated performance on existing long-context memory benchmarks like LoCoMo perform poorly in our agentic setting, exposing a gap in current evaluations for agents with memory.]]></description>

Fault injection attacks on embedded neural network models have been shown as a potent threat. Numerous works studied resilience of models from various points of view. As of now, there is no comprehensive study that would evaluate the influence of number representations used for model parameters against electromagnetic fault injection (EMFI) attacks.
  In this paper, we investigate how four different number representations influence the success of an EMFI attack on embedded neural network models. We chose two common floating-point representations (32-bit, and 16-bit), and two integer representations (8-bit, and 4-bit). We deployed four common image classifiers, ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, and VGG-11, on an embedded memory chip, and utilized a low-cost EMFI platform to trigger faults. Our results show that while floating-point representations exhibit almost a complete degradation in accuracy (Top-1 and Top-5) after a single fault injection, integer representations offer better resistance overall. Especially, when considering the the 8-bit representation on a relatively large network (VGG-11), the Top-1 accuracies stay at around 70% and the Top-5 at around 90%.]]></description>

This study investigates generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) usage of university students who study alongside their professional career. Previous literature has paid little attention to part-time students and the intersectional use of GenAI between education and business. This study examines with a grounded theory approach the characteristics of GenAI usage of part-time students. Eleven students from a distance learning university were interviewed. Three causal and four intervening conditions, as well as strategies were identified, to influence the use of GenAI. The study highlights both the potential and challenges of GenAI usage in education and business. While GenAI can significantly enhance productivity and learning outcomes, concerns about ethical implications, reliability, and the risk of academic misconduct persist. The developed grounded model offers a comprehensive understanding of GenAI usage among students, providing valuable insights for educators, policymakers, and developers of GenAI tools seeking to bridge the gap between education and business.]]></description>

Probing is widely adopted in computer vision to faithfully evaluate self-supervised learning (SSL) embeddings, as fine-tuning may misrepresent their inherent quality. In contrast, audio SSL models still rely on fine-tuning because simple probing fails to unlock their full potential and alters their rankings when competing for SOTA on AudioSet. Hence, a robust and efficient probing mechanism is required to guide the trajectory of audio SSL towards reliable and reproducible methods. We introduce Convex Gated Probing (CGP), a prototype-based method that drastically closes the gap between fine-tuning and probing in audio. CGP efficiently utilizes all frozen layers via a gating mechanism and exposes the location of latent task-relevant information. Guided by CGP, we rework the entire SSL pipeline of current SOTA audio models that use legacy implementations of prior SSL methods. By refining data preprocessing, model architecture, and pre-training recipe, we introduce Better Audio Transformer (BAT), and establish new SOTA on audio benchmarks.]]></description>

Large Language Models (LLMs) are beginning to reshape how media professionals verify information, yet automated support for detecting check-worthy claims a key step in the fact-checking process remains limited. We introduce the Multi-Check-Worthy (MultiCW) dataset, a balanced multilingual benchmark for check-worthy claim detection spanning 16 languages, 7 topical domains, and 2 writing styles. It consists of 123,722 samples, evenly distributed between noisy (informal) and structured (formal) texts, with balanced representation of check-worthy and non-check-worthy classes across all languages. To probe robustness, we also introduce an equally balanced out-of-distribution evaluation set of 27,761 samples in 4 additional languages. To provide baselines, we benchmark 3 common fine-tuned multilingual transformers against a diverse set of 15 commercial and open LLMs under zero-shot settings. Our findings show that fine-tuned models consistently outperform zero-shot LLMs on claim classification and show strong out-of-distribution generalization across languages, domains, and styles. MultiCW provides a rigorous multilingual resource for advancing automated fact-checking and enables systematic comparisons between fine-tuned models and cutting-edge LLMs on the check-worthy claim detection task.]]></description>

Arabic dialects have long been under-represented in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research due to their non-standardization and high variability, which pose challenges for computational modeling. Recent advances in the field, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), offer promising avenues to address this gap by enabling Arabic to be modeled as a pluricentric language rather than a monolithic system. This paper presents Aladdin-FTI, our submission to the AMIYA shared task. The proposed system is designed to both generate and translate dialectal Arabic (DA). Specifically, the model supports text generation in Moroccan, Egyptian, Palestinian, Syrian, and Saudi dialects, as well as bidirectional translation between these dialects, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), and English. The code and trained model are publicly available.]]></description>

Scaling language models to long contexts is often bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache. In deployed settings, long contexts are typically managed through compaction in token space via summarization. However, summarization can be highly lossy, substantially harming downstream performance. Recent work on Cartridges has shown that it is possible to train highly compact KV caches in latent space that closely match full-context performance, but at the cost of slow and expensive end-to-end optimization. This work describes an approach for fast context compaction in latent space through Attention Matching, which constructs compact keys and values to reproduce attention outputs and preserve attention mass at a per-KV-head level. We show that this formulation naturally decomposes into simple subproblems, some of which admit efficient closed-form solutions. Within this framework, we develop a family of methods that significantly push the Pareto frontier of compaction time versus quality, achieving up to 50x compaction in seconds on some datasets with little quality loss.]]></description>

Eyeframe lens tracing is an important process in the optical industry that requires sub-millimeter precision to ensure proper lens fitting and optimal vision correction. Traditional frame tracers rely on mechanical tools that need precise positioning and calibration, which are time-consuming and require additional equipment, creating an inefficient workflow for opticians. This work presents a novel approach based on artificial vision that utilizes multi-view information. The proposed algorithm operates on images captured from an InVision system. The full pipeline includes image acquisition, frame segmentation to isolate the eyeframe from background, depth estimation to obtain 3D spatial information, and multi-view processing that integrates segmented RGB images with depth data for precise frame contour measurement. To this end, different configurations and variants are proposed and analyzed on real data, providing competitive measurements from still color images with respect to other solutions, while eliminating the need for specialized tracing equipment and reducing workflow complexity for optical technicians.]]></description>

We present the first high-probability regret bound for classical online Q-learning in infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision processes, without relying on optimism or bonus terms. We first analyze Boltzmann Q-learning with decaying temperature and show that its regret depends critically on the suboptimality gap of the MDP: for sufficiently large gaps, the regret is sublinear, while for small gaps it deteriorates and can approach linear growth. To address this limitation, we study a Smoothed $ε_n$-Greedy exploration scheme that combines $ε_n$-greedy and Boltzmann exploration, for which we prove a gap-robust regret bound of near-$\tilde{O}(N^{9/10})$. To analyze these algorithms, we develop a high-probability concentration bound for contractive Markovian stochastic approximation with iterate- and time-dependent transition dynamics. This bound may be of independent interest as the contraction factor in our bound is governed by the mixing time and is allowed to converge to one asymptotically.]]></description>

We analyze speech embeddings from structured clinical interviews of psychotic patients and healthy controls by treating language production as a high-dimensional dynamical process. Lyapunov exponent (LE) spectra are computed from word-level and answer-level embeddings generated by two distinct large language models, allowing us to assess the stability of the conclusions with respect to different embedding presentations. Word-level embeddings exhibit uniformly contracting dynamics with no positive LE, while answer-level embeddings, in spite of the overall contraction, display a number of positive LEs and higher-dimensional attractors. The resulting LE spectra robustly separate psychotic from healthy speech, while differentiation within the psychotic group is not statistically significant overall, despite a tendency of the most severe cases to occupy distinct dynamical regimes. These findings indicate that nonlinear dynamical invariants of speech embeddings provide a physics-inspired probe of disordered cognition whose conclusions remain stable across embedding models.]]></description>

Encoding classical data into quantum states is a central bottleneck in quantum machine learning: many widely used encodings are circuit-inefficient, requiring deep circuits and substantial quantum resources, which limits scalability on quantum hardware. In this work, we propose TNQE, a circuit-efficient quantum data encoding framework built on structured unitary tensor network (TN) representations. TNQE first represents each classical input via a TN decomposition and then compiles the resulting tensor cores into an encoding circuit through two complementary core-to-circuit strategies. To make this compilation trainable while respecting the unitary nature of quantum operations, we introduce a unitary-aware constraint that parameterizes TN cores as learnable block unitaries, enabling them to be directly optimized and directly encoded as quantum operators. The proposed TNQE framework enables explicit control over circuit depth and qubit resources, allowing the construction of shallow, resource-efficient circuits. Across a range of benchmarks, TNQE achieves encoding circuits as shallow as $0.04\times$ the depth of amplitude encoding, while naturally scaling to high-resolution images ($256 \times 256$) and demonstrating practical feasibility on real quantum hardware.]]></description>

This note gives a self-contained overview of some important properties of the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance, compared with the standard linear optimal transport (OT) framework. More specifically, I explore the following questions: are GW optimal transport plans sparse? Under what conditions are they supported on a permutation? Do they satisfy a form of cyclical monotonicity? In particular, I present the conditionally negative semi-definite property and show that, when it holds, there are GW optimal plans that are sparse and supported on a permutation.]]></description>

In this work, we develop, for the first time, a supervised classification framework with class-dependent rewards (CDR) to predict $\geq$MM flares within 24 hr. We construct multiple datasets, covering knowledge-informed features and line-of sight (LOS) magnetograms. We also apply three deep learning models (CNN, CNN-BiLSTM, and Transformer) and three CDR counterparts (CDR-CNN, CDR-CNN-BiLSTM, and CDR-Transformer). First, we analyze the importance of LOS magnetic field parameters with the Transformer, then compare its performance using LOS-only, vector-only, and combined magnetic field parameters. Second, we compare flare prediction performance based on CDR models versus deep learning counterparts. Third, we perform sensitivity analysis on reward engineering for CDR models. Fourth, we use the SHAP method for model interpretability. Finally, we conduct performance comparison between our models and NASA/CCMC. The main findings are: (1)Among LOS feature combinations, R_VALUE and AREA_ACR consistently yield the best results. (2)Transformer achieves better performance with combined LOS and vector magnetic field data than with either alone. (3)Models using knowledge-informed features outperform those using magnetograms. (4)While CNN and CNN-BiLSTM outperform their CDR counterparts on magnetograms, CDR-Transformer is slightly superior to its deep learning counterpart when using knowledge-informed features. Among all models, CDR-Transformer achieves the best performance. (5)The predictive performance of the CDR models is not overly sensitive to the reward choices.(6)Through SHAP analysis, the CDR model tends to regard TOTUSJH as more important, while the Transformer tends to prioritize R_VALUE more.(7)Under identical prediction time and active region (AR) number, the CDR-Transformer shows superior predictive capabilities compared to NASA/CCMC.]]></description>

Speech emotion recognition (SER) has traditionally relied on categorical or dimensional labels. However, this technique is limited in representing both the diversity and interpretability of emotions. To overcome this limitation, we focus on color attributes, such as hue, saturation, and value, to represent emotions as continuous and interpretable scores. We annotated an emotional speech corpus with color attributes via crowdsourcing and analyzed them. Moreover, we built regression models for color attributes in SER using machine learning and deep learning, and explored the multitask learning of color attribute regression and emotion classification. As a result, we demonstrated the relationship between color attributes and emotions in speech, and successfully developed color attribute regression models for SER. We also showed that multitask learning improved the performance of each task.]]></description>

Self-supervised pretraining has transformed computer vision by enabling data-efficient fine-tuning, yet high-resolution training typically requires server-scale infrastructure, limiting in-domain foundation model development for many research laboratories. Masked Autoencoders (MAE) reduce computation by encoding only visible tokens, but combining MAE with hierarchical downsampling architectures remains structurally challenging due to dense grid priors and mask-aware design compromises. We introduce AFFMAE, a masking-friendly hierarchical pretraining framework built on adaptive, off-grid token merging. By discarding masked tokens and performing dynamic merging exclusively over visible tokens, AFFMAE removes dense-grid assumptions while preserving hierarchical scalability. We developed numerically stable mixed-precision Flash-style cluster attention kernels, and mitigate sparse-stage representation collapse via deep supervision. On high-resolution electron microscopy segmentation, AFFMAE matches ViT-MAE performance at equal parameter count while reducing FLOPs by up to 7x, halving memory usage, and achieving faster training on a single RTX 5090.

Interactive large language model (LLM) agents operating via multi-turn dialogue and multi-step tool calling are increasingly used in production. Benchmarks for these agents must both reliably compare models and yield on-policy training data. Prior agentic benchmarks (e.g., tau-bench, tau2-bench, AppWorld) rely on fully deterministic backends, which are costly to build and iterate. We propose Proxy State-Based Evaluation, an LLM-driven simulation framework that preserves final state-based evaluation without a deterministic database. Specifically, a scenario specifies the user goal, user/system facts, expected final state, and expected agent behavior, and an LLM state tracker infers a structured proxy state from the full interaction trace. LLM judges then verify goal completion and detect tool/user hallucinations against scenario constraints. Empirically, our benchmark produces stable, model-differentiating rankings across families and inference-time reasoning efforts, and its on-/off-policy rollouts provide supervision that transfers to unseen scenarios. Careful scenario specification yields near-zero simulator hallucination rates as supported by ablation studies. The framework also supports sensitivity analyses over user personas. Human-LLM judge agreement exceeds 90%, indicating reliable automated evaluation. Overall, proxy state-based evaluation offers a practical, scalable alternative to deterministic agentic benchmarks for industrial LLM agents.]]></description>

Multimodal fusion frameworks, which integrate diverse medical imaging modalities (e.g., MRI, CT), have shown great potential in applications such as skin cancer detection, dementia diagnosis, and brain tumor prediction. However, existing multimodal fusion methods face significant challenges. First, they often rely on computationally expensive models, limiting their applicability in low-resource environments. Second, they often employ cascaded attention modules, which potentially increase risk of information loss during inter-module transitions and hinder their capacity to effectively capture robust shared representations across modalities. This restricts their generalization in multi-disease analysis tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hybrid Parallel-Fusion Cascaded Attention Network (HyPCA-Net), composed of two core novel blocks: (a) a computationally efficient residual adaptive learning attention block for capturing refined modality-specific representations, and (b) a dual-view cascaded attention block aimed at learning robust shared representations across diverse modalities. Extensive experiments on ten publicly available datasets exhibit that HyPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing leading methods, with improvements of up to 5.2% in performance and reductions of up to 73.1% in computational cost.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated annotators to scale dataset creation, yet their reliability as unbiased annotators--especially for low-resource and identity-sensitive settings--remains poorly understood. In this work, we study the behavior of LLMs as zero-shot annotators for Bangla hate speech, a task where even human agreement is challenging, and annotator bias can have serious downstream consequences. We conduct a systematic benchmark of 17 LLMs using a unified evaluation framework. Our analysis uncovers annotator bias and substantial instability in model judgments. Surprisingly, increased model scale does not guarantee improved annotation quality--smaller, more task-aligned models frequently exhibit more consistent behavior than their larger counterparts. These results highlight important limitations of current LLMs for sensitive annotation tasks in low-resource languages and underscore the need for careful evaluation before deployment.]]></description>

We propose EasyControlEdge, adapting an image-generation foundation model to edge detection. In real-world edge detection (e.g., floor-plan walls, satellite roads/buildings, and medical organ boundaries), crispness and data efficiency are crucial, yet producing crisp raw edge maps with limited training samples remains challenging. Although image-generation foundation models perform well on many downstream tasks, their pretrained priors for data-efficient transfer and iterative refinement for high-frequency detail preservation remain underexploited for edge detection. To enable crisp and data-efficient edge detection using these capabilities, we introduce an edge-specialized adaptation of image-generation foundation models. To better specialize the foundation model for edge detection, we incorporate an edge-oriented objective with an efficient pixel-space loss. At inference, we introduce guidance based on unconditional dynamics, enabling a single model to control the edge density through a guidance scale. Experiments on BSDS500, NYUDv2, BIPED, and CubiCasa compare against state-of-the-art methods and show consistent gains, particularly under no-post-processing crispness evaluation and with limited training data.]]></description>

We revisit the classical problem of universal prediction of stochastic sequences with a finite time horizon $T$ known to the learner. The question we investigate is whether it is possible to derive vanishing regret bounds that hold with high probability, complementing existing bounds from the literature that hold in expectation. We propose such high-probability bounds which have a very similar form as the prior expectation bounds. For the case of universal prediction of a stochastic process over a countable alphabet, our bound states a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2} δ^{-1/2})$ with probability as least $1-δ$ compared to prior known in-expectation bounds of the order $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2})$. We also propose an impossibility result which proves that it is not possible to improve the exponent of $δ$ in a bound of the same form without making additional assumptions.]]></description>

Circuit cutting decomposes a large quantum circuit into a collection of smaller subcircuits. The outputs of these subcircuits are then classically reconstructed to recover the original expectation values. While prior work characterises cutting overhead largely in terms of subcircuit counts and sampling complexity, its end-to-end impact on iterative, estimator-driven training pipelines remains insufficiently measured from a systems perspective. In this paper, we propose a cut-aware estimator execution pipeline that treats circuit cutting as a staged distributed workload and instruments each estimator query into partitioning, subexperiment generation, parallel execution, and classical reconstruction phases. Using logged runtime traces and learning outcomes on two binary classification workloads (Iris and MNIST), we quantify cutting overheads, scaling limits, and sensitivity to injected stragglers, and we evaluate whether accuracy and robustness are preserved under matched training budgets. Our measurements show that cutting introduces substantial end-to-end overheads that grow with the number of cuts, and that reconstruction constitutes a dominant fraction of per-query time, bounding achievable speed-up under increased parallelism. Despite these systems costs, test accuracy and robustness are preserved in the measured regimes, with configuration-dependent improvements observed in some cut settings. These results indicate that practical scaling of circuit cutting for learning workloads hinges on reducing and overlapping reconstruction and on scheduling policies that account for barrier-dominated critical paths.]]></description>

Large-scale video repositories are increasingly available for modern video understanding and generation tasks. However, transforming raw videos into high-quality, task-specific datasets remains costly and inefficient. We present DataCube, an intelligent platform for automatic video processing, multi-dimensional profiling, and query-driven retrieval. DataCube constructs structured semantic representations of video clips and supports hybrid retrieval with neural re-ranking and deep semantic matching. Through an interactive web interface, users can efficiently construct customized video subsets from massive repositories for training, analysis, and evaluation, and build searchable systems over their own private video collections. The system is publicly accessible at https://datacube.baai.ac.cn/.

Learning latent actions from action-free video has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling up controllable world model learning. Latent actions provide a natural interface for users to iteratively generate and manipulate videos. However, most existing approaches rely on monolithic inverse and forward dynamics models that learn a single latent action to control the entire scene, and therefore struggle in complex environments where multiple entities act simultaneously. This paper introduces Factored Latent Action Model (FLAM), a factored dynamics framework that decomposes the scene into independent factors, each inferring its own latent action and predicting its own next-step factor value. This factorized structure enables more accurate modeling of complex multi-entity dynamics and improves video generation quality in action-free video settings compared to monolithic models. Based on experiments on both simulation and real-world multi-entity datasets, we find that FLAM outperforms prior work in prediction accuracy and representation quality, and facilitates downstream policy learning, demonstrating the benefits of factorized latent action models.]]></description>

Time series data are prone to noise in various domains, and training samples may contain low-predictability patterns that deviate from the normal data distribution, leading to training instability or convergence to poor local minima. Therefore, mitigating the adverse effects of low-predictability samples is crucial for time series analysis tasks such as time series forecasting (TSF) and time series classification (TSC). While many deep learning models have achieved promising performance, few consider how to identify and penalize low-predictability samples to improve model performance from the training perspective. To fill this gap, we propose a general Amortized Predictability-aware Training Framework (APTF) for both TSF and TSC. APTF introduces two key designs that enable the model to focus on high-predictability samples while still learning appropriately from low-predictability ones: (i) a Hierarchical Predictability-aware Loss (HPL) that dynamically identifies low-predictability samples and progressively expands their loss penalty as training evolves, and (ii) an amortization model that mitigates predictability estimation errors caused by model bias, further enhancing HPL's effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/Meteor-Stars/APTF.]]></description>

Modeling multiscale patterns is crucial for long-term time series forecasting (TSF). However, redundancy and noise in time series, together with semantic gaps between non-adjacent scales, make the efficient alignment and integration of multi-scale temporal dependencies challenging. To address this, we propose SEMixer, a lightweight multiscale model designed for long-term TSF. SEMixer features two key components: a Random Attention Mechanism (RAM) and a Multiscale Progressive Mixing Chain (MPMC). RAM captures diverse time-patch interactions during training and aggregates them via dropout ensemble at inference, enhancing patch-level semantics and enabling MLP-Mixer to better model multi-scale dependencies. MPMC further stacks RAM and MLP-Mixer in a memory-efficient manner, achieving more effective temporal mixing. It addresses semantic gaps across scales and facilitates better multiscale modeling and forecasting performance. We not only validate the effectiveness of SEMixer on 10 public datasets, but also on the \textit{2025 CCF AlOps Challenge} based on 21GB real wireless network data, where SEMixer achieves third place. The code is available at the link https://github.com/Meteor-Stars/SEMixer.]]></description>

Bayesian quadrature is a probabilistic, model-based approach to numerical integration, the estimation of intractable integrals, or expectations. Although Bayesian quadrature was popularised already in the 1980s, no systematic and comprehensive treatment has been published. The purpose of this survey is to fill this gap. We review the mathematical foundations of Bayesian quadrature from different points of view; present a systematic taxonomy for classifying different Bayesian quadrature methods along the three axes of modelling, inference, and sampling; collect general theoretical guarantees; and provide a controlled numerical study that explores and illustrates the effect of different choices along the axes of the taxonomy. We also provide a realistic assessment of practical challenges and limitations to application of Bayesian quadrature methods and include an up-to-date and nearly exhaustive bibliography that covers not only machine learning and statistics literature but all areas of mathematics and engineering in which Bayesian quadrature or equivalent methods have seen use.]]></description>

Surface extraction from implicit neural representations modelling a single class surface is a well-known task. However, there exist no surface extraction methods from an implicit representation of multiple classes that guarantee topological correctness and no holes. In this work, we lay the groundwork by introducing a 2D boundary extraction algorithm for the multi-class case focusing on topological consistency and water-tightness, which also allows for setting minimum detail restraint on the approximation. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm using geological modelling data, showcasing its adaptiveness and ability to honour complex topology.]]></description>

Deep learning has improved automated electrocardiogram (ECG) classification, but limited insight into prediction reliability hinders its use in safety-critical settings. This paper proposes UCTECG-Net, an uncertainty-aware hybrid architecture that combines one-dimensional convolutions and Transformer encoders to process raw ECG signals and their spectrograms jointly. Evaluated on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and PTB Diagnostic datasets, UCTECG-Net outperforms LSTM, CNN1D, and Transformer baselines in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score, achieving up to 98.58% accuracy on MIT-BIH and 99.14% on PTB. To assess predictive reliability, we integrate three uncertainty quantification methods (Monte Carlo Dropout, Deep Ensembles, and Ensemble Monte Carlo Dropout) into all models and analyze their behavior using an uncertainty-aware confusion matrix and derived metrics. The results show that UCTECG-Net, particularly with Ensemble or EMCD, provides more reliable and better-aligned uncertainty estimates than competing architectures, offering a stronger basis for risk-aware ECG decision support.]]></description>

This paper introduces a novel approach to sea ice modeling using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), utilizing the natural graph structure of sea ice, where nodes represent individual ice pieces, and edges model the physical interactions, including collisions. This concept is developed within a one-dimensional framework as a foundational step. Traditional numerical methods, while effective, are computationally intensive and less scalable. By utilizing GNNs, the proposed model, termed the Collision-captured Network (CN), integrates data assimilation (DA) techniques to effectively learn and predict sea ice dynamics under various conditions. The approach was validated using synthetic data, both with and without observed data points, and it was found that the model accelerates the simulation of trajectories without compromising accuracy. This advancement offers a more efficient tool for forecasting in marginal ice zones (MIZ) and highlights the potential of combining machine learning with data assimilation for more effective and efficient modeling.]]></description>

Neural operators offer an effective framework for learning solutions of partial differential equations for many physical systems in a resolution-invariant and data-driven manner. Existing neural operators, however, often suffer from instability in multi-layer iteration and long-horizon rollout, which stems from the unconstrained Euclidean latent space updates that violate the geometric and conservation laws. To address this challenge, we propose to constrain manifolds with low-rank Lie algebra parameterization that performs group action updates on the latent representation. Our method, termed Manifold Constraining based on Lie group (MCL), acts as an efficient \emph{plug-and-play} module that enforces geometric inductive bias to existing neural operators. Extensive experiments on various partial differential equations, such as 1-D Burgers and 2-D Navier-Stokes, over a wide range of parameters and steps demonstrate that our method effectively lowers the relative prediction error by 30-50\% at the cost of 2.26\% of parameter increase. The results show that our approach provides a scalable solution for improving long-term prediction fidelity by addressing the principled geometric constraints absent in the neural operator updates.]]></description>

Neurochaos Learning (NL) has shown promise in recent times over traditional deep learning due to its two key features: ability to learn from small sized training samples, and low compute requirements. In prior work, NL has been implemented and extensively tested on separable and time series data, and demonstrated its superior performance on both classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we investigate the next step in NL, viz., applying NL to linked data, in particular, data that is represented in the form of knowledge graphs. We integrate linked data into NL by implementing node aggregation on knowledge graphs, and then feeding the aggregated node features to the simplest NL architecture: ChaosNet. We demonstrate the results of our implementation on homophilic graph datasets as well as heterophilic graph datasets of verying heterophily. We show better efficacy of our approach on homophilic graphs than on heterophilic graphs. While doing so, we also present our analysis of the results, as well as suggestions for future work.]]></description>

Large language models (LLMs) are trained on web-scale corpora that exhibit steep power-law distributions, in which the distribution of knowledge is highly long-tailed, with most appearing infrequently. While scaling has improved average-case performance, persistent failures on low-frequency, domain-specific, cultural, and temporal knowledge remain poorly characterized. This paper develops a structured taxonomy and analysis of long-Tail Knowledge in large language models, synthesizing prior work across technical and sociotechnical perspectives.
  We introduce a structured analytical framework that synthesizes prior work across four complementary axes: how long-Tail Knowledge is defined, the mechanisms by which it is lost or distorted during training and inference, the technical interventions proposed to mitigate these failures, and the implications of these failures for fairness, accountability, transparency, and user trust. We further examine how existing evaluation practices obscure tail behavior and complicate accountability for rare but consequential failures. The paper concludes by identifying open challenges related to privacy, sustainability, and governance that constrain long-Tail Knowledge representation. Taken together, this paper provides a unifying conceptual framework for understanding how long-Tail Knowledge is defined, lost, evaluated, and manifested in deployed language model systems.]]></description>

In this thesis, I refine our understanding as to what conclusions we can reach from coreference-based evaluations by expanding existing evaluation practices and considering the extent to which evaluation results are either converging or conflicting. First, I analyze standard coreference evaluations and show that their design often leads to non-generalizable conclusions due to issues of measurement validity - including contestedness (multiple, competing definitions of coreference) and convergent validity (evaluation results that rank models differently across benchmarks). Second, I propose and implement a novel evaluation focused on testing systems' ability to infer the relative plausibility of events, a key aspect of resolving coreference. Through this extended evaluation, I find that contemporary language models demonstrate strong performance on standard benchmarks - improving over earlier baseline systems within certain domains and types of coreference - but remain sensitive to the evaluation conditions: they often fail to generalize in ways one would expect a human to be capable of when evaluation contexts are slightly modified. Taken together, these findings clarify both the strengths, such as improved accuracy over baselines on widely used evaluations, and the limitations of the current NLP paradigm, including weaknesses in measurement validity, and suggest directions for future work in developing better evaluation methods and more genuinely generalizable systems.]]></description>

Adaptation methods have been a workhorse for unlocking the transformative power of pre-trained diffusion models in diverse applications. Existing approaches often abstract adaptation objectives as a reward function and steer diffusion models to generate high-reward samples. However, these approaches can incur high computational overhead due to additional training, or rely on stringent assumptions on the reward such as differentiability. Moreover, despite their empirical success, theoretical justification and guarantees are seldom established. In this paper, we propose DOIT (Doob-Oriented Inference-time Transformation), a training-free and computationally efficient adaptation method that applies to generic, non-differentiable rewards. The key framework underlying our method is a measure transport formulation that seeks to transport the pre-trained generative distribution to a high-reward target distribution. We leverage Doob's $h$-transform to realize this transport, which induces a dynamic correction to the diffusion sampling process and enables efficient simulation-based computation without modifying the pre-trained model. Theoretically, we establish a high probability convergence guarantee to the target high-reward distribution via characterizing the approximation error in the dynamic Doob's correction. Empirically, on D4RL offline RL benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while preserving sampling efficiency.]]></description>

Multimodal systems are vulnerable to partial or complete loss of input channels at deployment, which undermines reliability in real-world settings. This paper presents ModalImmune, a training framework that enforces modality immunity by intentionally and controllably collapsing selected modality information during training so the model learns joint representations that are robust to destructive modality influence. The framework combines a spectrum-adaptive collapse regularizer, an information-gain guided controller for targeted interventions, curvature-aware gradient masking to stabilize destructive updates, and a certified Neumann-truncated hyper-gradient procedure for automatic meta-parameter adaptation. Empirical evaluation on standard multimodal benchmarks demonstrates that ModalImmune improves resilience to modality removal and corruption while retaining convergence stability and reconstruction capacity.]]></description>

Coordinating large populations of interacting agents is a central challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where the size of the joint state-action space scales exponentially with the number of agents. Mean-field methods alleviate this burden by aggregating agent interactions, but these approaches assume homogeneous interactions. Recent graphon-based frameworks capture heterogeneity, but are computationally expensive as the number of agents grows. Therefore, we introduce $\texttt{GMFS}$, a $\textbf{G}$raphon $\textbf{M}$ean-$\textbf{F}$ield $\textbf{S}$ubsampling framework for scalable cooperative MARL with heterogeneous agent interactions. By subsampling $κ$ agents according to interaction strength, we approximate the graphon-weighted mean-field and learn a policy with sample complexity $\mathrm{poly}(κ)$ and optimality gap $O(1/\sqrtκ)$. We verify our theory with numerical simulations in robotic coordination, showing that $\texttt{GMFS}$ achieves near-optimal performance.]]></description>

Permanent citizens' assemblies are ongoing deliberative bodies composed of randomly selected citizens, organized into panels that rotate over time. Unlike one-off panels, which represent the population in a single snapshot, permanent assemblies enable shifting participation across multiple rounds. This structure offers a powerful framework for ensuring that different groups of individuals are represented over time across successive panels. In particular, it allows smaller groups of individuals that may not warrant representation in every individual panel to be represented across a sequence of them. We formalize this temporal sortition framework by requiring proportional representation both within each individual panel and across the sequence of panels.
  Building on the work of Ebadian and Micha (2025), we consider a setting in which the population lies in a metric space, and the goal is to achieve both proportional representation, ensuring that every group of citizens receives adequate representation, and individual fairness, ensuring that each individual has an equal probability of being selected. We extend the notion of representation to a temporal setting by requiring that every initial segment of the panel sequence, viewed as a cumulative whole, proportionally reflects the structure of the population. We present algorithms that provide varying guarantees of proportional representation, both within individual panels and across any sequence of panels, while also maintaining individual fairness over time.]]></description>

Several complex physical systems are governed by multi-scale partial differential equations (PDEs) that exhibit both smooth low-frequency components and localized high-frequency structures. Existing physics-informed neural network (PINN) methods typically train with fixed coordinate system inputs, where geometric misalignment with these structures induces gradient stiffness and ill-conditioning that hinder convergence. To address this issue, we introduce a mapping paradigm that reshapes the input coordinates through differentiable geometric compactification mappings and couples the geometric structure of PDEs with the spectral properties of residual operators. Based on this paradigm, we propose Geometric Compactification (GC)-PINN, a framework that introduces three mapping strategies for periodic boundaries, far-field scale expansion, and localized singular structures in the input domain without modifying the underlying PINN architecture. Extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that this approach yields more uniform residual distributions and higher solution accuracy on representative 1D and 2D PDEs, while improving training stability and convergence speed.]]></description>

Driven by our mission of "uplifting the world with memory," this paper explores the design concept of "memory" that is essential for achieving artificial superintelligence (ASI). Rather than proposing novel methods, we focus on several alternative approaches whose potential benefits are widely imaginable, yet have remained largely unexplored. The currently dominant paradigm, which can be termed "extract then store," involves extracting information judged to be useful from experiences and saving only the extracted content. However, this approach inherently risks the loss of information, as some valuable knowledge particularly for different tasks may be discarded in the extraction process. In contrast, we emphasize the "store then on-demand extract" approach, which seeks to retain raw experiences and flexibly apply them to various tasks as needed, thus avoiding such information loss. In addition, we highlight two further approaches: discovering deeper insights from large collections of probabilistic experiences, and improving experience collection efficiency by sharing stored experiences. While these approaches seem intuitively effective, our simple experiments demonstrate that this is indeed the case. Finally, we discuss major challenges that have limited investigation into these promising directions and propose research topics to address them.]]></description>

Despite the continuous research and evolution of language models, they sometimes underperform previous versions. Existing approaches to overcome these challenges are resource-intensive, highlighting the need for alternatives that enable immediate action. We assume that each language model has a local module inside that is suitable for a specific function. First, this work identifies a set of modules showing consistent and local activation changes under an inference workload through activation-based analysis. Subsequently, we transplant an internal module that is properly activated for a specific task into the target model, leading to immediate and measurable functional changes without additional training or fine-tuning. To experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the transplant technique, we quantify the relationship between transplant strength and performance improvement under different conditions for two language models. In the cross-generation setting, we find that transplanting activation-selected modules can substantially improve the underperforming model, reaching up to twice the target baseline and achieving gap-based recovery above 100%. Moreover, in transplant experiments between a base model and its instruction-tuned counterpart, transplantation improves the underperforming model toward the stronger baseline, yielding up to about 2.33 times the target baseline with gap-based recovery reaching up to 100% in the best case. These results show that meaningful capacity transfer can be realized through the implantation of highly localized modules implied by language models. Overall, this work provides empirical evidence for task-localized modularity in language models and presents a new research area: model transplantation.]]></description>

LLM-for-time series (TS) methods typically treat time shallowly, injecting positional or prompt-based cues once at the input of a largely frozen decoder, which limits temporal reasoning as this information degrades through the layers. We introduce Temporal-Prior Conditioning (TPC), which elevates time to a first-class modality that conditions the model at multiple depths. TPC attaches a small set of learnable time series tokens to the patch stream; at selected layers these tokens cross-attend to temporal embeddings derived from compact, human-readable temporal descriptors encoded by the same frozen LLM, then feed temporal context back via self-attention. This disentangles time series signal and temporal information while maintaining a low parameter budget. We show that by training only the cross-attention modules and explicitly disentangling time series signal and temporal information, TPC consistently outperforms both full fine-tuning and shallow conditioning strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance in long-term forecasting across diverse datasets.

Robots executing iterative tasks in complex, uncertain environments require control strategies that balance robustness, safety, and high performance. This paper introduces a safe information-theoretic learning model predictive control (SIT-LMPC) algorithm for iterative tasks. Specifically, we design an iterative control framework based on an information-theoretic model predictive control algorithm to address a constrained infinite-horizon optimal control problem for discrete-time nonlinear stochastic systems. An adaptive penalty method is developed to ensure safety while balancing optimality. Trajectories from previous iterations are utilized to learn a value function using normalizing flows, which enables richer uncertainty modeling compared to Gaussian priors. SIT-LMPC is designed for highly parallel execution on graphics processing units, allowing efficient real-time optimization. Benchmark simulations and hardware experiments demonstrate that SIT-LMPC iteratively improves system performance while robustly satisfying system constraints.]]></description>

We study the \emph{Submodular Welfare Problem} (SWP), where items are partitioned among agents with monotone submodular utilities to maximize the total welfare under \emph{bandit feedback}. Classical SWP assumes full value-oracle access, achieving $(1-1/e)$ approximations via continuous-greedy algorithms. We extend this to a \emph{multi-agent combinatorial bandit} framework (\textsc{MA-CMAB}), where actions are partitions under full-bandit feedback with non-communicating agents. Unlike prior single-agent or separable multi-agent CMAB models, our setting couples agents through shared allocation constraints. We propose an explore-then-commit strategy with randomized assignments, achieving $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$ regret against a $(1-1/e)$ benchmark, the first such guarantee for partition-based submodular welfare problem under bandit feedback.]]></description>

Energy theft poses a significant threat to the stability and efficiency of smart grids, leading to substantial economic losses and operational challenges. Traditional centralized machine learning approaches for theft detection require aggregating user data, raising serious concerns about privacy and data security. These issues are further exacerbated in smart meter environments, where devices are often resource-constrained and lack the capacity to run heavy models. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving federated learning framework for energy theft detection that addresses both privacy and computational constraints. Our approach leverages a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) model, suitable for deployment on low-power smart meters, and integrates basic differential privacy (DP) by injecting Gaussian noise into local model updates before aggregation. This ensures formal privacy guarantees without compromising learning performance. We evaluate our framework on a real-world smart meter dataset under both IID and non-IID data distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores while maintaining privacy and efficiency. This makes the proposed solution practical and scalable for secure energy theft detection in next-generation smart grid infrastructures.]]></description>

We show that training AI agents on high-fidelity reinforcement learning environments produces capabilities that generalize beyond the training distribution. We introduce \corecraft{}, the first environment in \textsc{EnterpriseGym}, Surge AI's suite of agentic RL environments. \corecraft{} is a fully operational enterprise simulation of a customer support organization, comprising over 2,500 entities across 14 entity types with 23 unique tools, designed to measure whether AI agents can perform the multi-step, domain-specific work that real jobs demand. Frontier models such as GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.6 solve fewer than 30\% of tasks when all expert-authored rubric criteria must be satisfied. Using this environment, we train GLM~4.6 with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and adaptive clipping. After a single epoch of training, the model improves from 25.37\% to 36.76\% task pass rate on held-out evaluation tasks. More importantly, these gains transfer to out-of-distribution benchmarks: +4.5\% on BFCL Parallel, +7.4\% on $τ^2$-Bench Retail, and +6.8\% on Toolathlon (Pass@1). We believe three environment properties are consistent with the observed transfer: task-centric world building that optimizes for diverse, challenging tasks; expert-authored rubrics enabling reliable reward computation; and enterprise workflows that reflect realistic professional patterns. Our results suggest that environment quality, diversity, and realism are key factors enabling generalizable agent capabilities.]]></description>

In this work, we propose a notion of practical learnability grounded in finite sample settings, and develop a conjugate learning theoretical framework based on convex conjugate duality to characterize this learnability property. Building on this foundation, we demonstrate that training deep neural networks (DNNs) with mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) achieves global optima of empirical risk by jointly controlling the extreme eigenvalues of a structure matrix and the gradient energy, and we establish a corresponding convergence theorem. We further elucidate the impact of batch size and model architecture (including depth, parameter count, sparsity, skip connections, and other characteristics) on non-convex optimization. Additionally, we derive a model-agnostic lower bound for the achievable empirical risk, theoretically demonstrating that data determines the fundamental limit of trainability. On the generalization front, we derive deterministic and probabilistic bounds on generalization error based on generalized conditional entropy measures. The former explicitly delineates the range of generalization error, while the latter characterizes the distribution of generalization error relative to the deterministic bounds under independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sampling conditions. Furthermore, these bounds explicitly quantify the influence of three key factors: (i) information loss induced by irreversibility in the model, (ii) the maximum attainable loss value, and (iii) the generalized conditional entropy of features with respect to labels. Moreover, they offer a unified theoretical lens for understanding the roles of regularization, irreversible transformations, and network depth in shaping the generalization behavior of deep neural networks. Extensive experiments validate all theoretical predictions, confirming the framework's correctness and consistency.]]></description>

Mobile edge computing (MEC) based wireless metaverse services offer an untethered, immersive experience to users, where the superior quality of experience (QoE) needs to be achieved under stringent latency constraints and visual quality demands. To achieve this, MEC-based intelligent resource allocation for virtual reality users needs to be supported by coordination across MEC servers to harness distributed data. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution, and can be combined with reinforcement learning (RL) to develop generalized policies across MEC-servers. However, conventional FL incurs transmitting the full model parameters across the MEC-servers and the cloud, and suffer performance degradation due to naive global aggregation, especially in heterogeneous multi-radio access technology environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Federated Split Decision Transformer (FSDT), an offline RL framework where the transformer model is partitioned between MEC servers and the cloud. Agent-specific components (e.g., MEC-based embedding and prediction layers) enable local adaptability, while shared global layers in the cloud facilitate cooperative training across MEC servers. Experimental results demonstrate that FSDT enhances QoE for up to 10% in heterogeneous environments compared to baselines, while offloadingnearly 98% of the transformer model parameters to the cloud, thereby reducing the computational burden on MEC servers.]]></description>

Modern AI agents are powerful but often fail to align with the idiosyncratic, evolving preferences of individual users. Prior approaches typically rely on static datasets, either training implicit preference models on interaction history or encoding user profiles in external memory. However, these approaches struggle with new users and with preferences that change over time. We introduce Personalized Agents from Human Feedback (PAHF), a framework for continual personalization in which agents learn online from live interaction using explicit per-user memory. PAHF operationalizes a three-step loop: (1) seeking pre-action clarification to resolve ambiguity, (2) grounding actions in preferences retrieved from memory, and (3) integrating post-action feedback to update memory when preferences drift. To evaluate this capability, we develop a four-phase protocol and two benchmarks in embodied manipulation and online shopping. These benchmarks quantify an agent's ability to learn initial preferences from scratch and subsequently adapt to persona shifts. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results show that integrating explicit memory with dual feedback channels is critical: PAHF learns substantially faster and consistently outperforms both no-memory and single-channel baselines, reducing initial personalization error and enabling rapid adaptation to preference shifts.]]></description>

Non-autoregressive (NAR) generation reduces decoding latency by predicting many tokens in parallel, but iterative refinement often suffers from error accumulation and distribution shift under self-generated drafts. Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) and their remasking samplers (e.g., ReMDM) can be viewed as modern NAR iterative refinement, where generation repeatedly revises a partially observed draft. In this work we show that \emph{training alone} can substantially improve the step-efficiency of MDLM/ReMDM sampling. We propose \textsc{DSL} (Discrete Stochastic Localization), which trains a single SNR-invariant denoiser across a continuum of corruption levels, bridging intermediate draft noise and mask-style endpoint corruption within one Diffusion Transformer. On OpenWebText, \textsc{DSL} fine-tuning yields large MAUVE gains at low step budgets, surpassing the MDLM+ReMDM baseline with \(\sim\)4$\times$ fewer denoiser evaluations, and matches autoregressive quality at high budgets. Analyses show improved self-correction and uncertainty calibration, making remasking markedly more compute-efficient.]]></description>

Physics-informed neural networks and neural operators often suffer from severe optimization difficulties caused by ill-conditioned gradients, multi-scale spectral behavior, and stiffness induced by physical constraints. Recently, the Muon optimizer has shown promise by performing orthogonalized updates in the singular-vector basis of the gradient, thereby improving geometric conditioning. However, its unit-singular-value updates may lead to overly aggressive steps and lack explicit stability guarantees when applied to physics-informed learning. In this work, we propose SpecMuon, a spectral-aware optimizer that integrates Muon's orthogonalized geometry with a mode-wise relaxed scalar auxiliary variable (RSAV) mechanism. By decomposing matrix-valued gradients into singular modes and applying RSAV updates individually along dominant spectral directions, SpecMuon adaptively regulates step sizes according to the global loss energy while preserving Muon's scale-balancing properties. This formulation interprets optimization as a multi-mode gradient flow and enables principled control of stiff spectral components. We establish rigorous theoretical properties of SpecMuon, including a modified energy dissipation law, positivity and boundedness of auxiliary variables, and global convergence with a linear rate under the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. Numerical experiments on physics-informed neural networks, DeepONets, and fractional PINN-DeepONets demonstrate that SpecMuon achieves faster convergence and improved stability compared with Adam, AdamW, and the original Muon optimizer on benchmark problems such as the one-dimensional Burgers equation and fractional partial differential equations.]]></description>

Training LLMs as interactive agents for multi-turn decision-making remains challenging, particularly in long-horizon tasks with sparse and delayed rewards, where agents must execute extended sequences of actions before receiving meaningful feedback. Most existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches model LLM agents as flat policies operating at a single time scale, selecting one action at each turn. In sparse-reward settings, such flat policies must propagate credit across the entire trajectory without explicit temporal abstraction, which often leads to unstable optimization and inefficient credit assignment.
  We propose HiPER, a novel Hierarchical Plan-Execute RL framework that explicitly separates high-level planning from low-level execution. HiPER factorizes the policy into a high-level planner that proposes subgoals and a low-level executor that carries them out over multiple action steps. To align optimization with this structure, we introduce a key technique called hierarchical advantage estimation (HAE), which carefully assigns credit at both the planning and execution levels. By aggregating returns over the execution of each subgoal and coordinating updates across the two levels, HAE provides an unbiased gradient estimator and provably reduces variance compared to flat generalized advantage estimation.
  Empirically, HiPER achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging interactive benchmarks, reaching 97.4\% success on ALFWorld and 83.3\% on WebShop with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (+6.6\% and +8.3\% over the best prior method), with especially large gains on long-horizon tasks requiring multiple dependent subtasks. These results highlight the importance of explicit hierarchical decomposition for scalable RL training of multi-turn LLM agents.]]></description>

We argue that uncertainty is a key and understudied limitation of LLMs' performance in creative writing, which is often characterized as trite and cliché-ridden. Literary theory identifies uncertainty as a necessary condition for creative expression, while current alignment strategies steer models away from uncertain outputs to ensure factuality and reduce hallucination. We formalize this tension by quantifying the "uncertainty gap" between human-authored stories and model-generated continuations. Through a controlled information-theoretic analysis of 28 LLMs on high-quality storytelling datasets, we demonstrate that human writing consistently exhibits significantly higher uncertainty than model outputs. We find that instruction-tuned and reasoning models exacerbate this trend compared to their base counterparts; furthermore, the gap is more pronounced in creative writing than in functional domains, and strongly correlates to writing quality. Achieving human-level creativity requires new uncertainty-aware alignment paradigms that can distinguish between destructive hallucinations and the constructive ambiguity required for literary richness.]]></description>

Emotional expression underpins natural communication and effective human-computer interaction. We present Emotion Collider (EC-Net), a hyperbolic hypergraph framework for multimodal emotion and sentiment modeling. EC-Net represents modality hierarchies using Poincare-ball embeddings and performs fusion through a hypergraph mechanism that passes messages bidirectionally between nodes and hyperedges. To sharpen class separation, contrastive learning is formulated in hyperbolic space with decoupled radial and angular objectives. High-order semantic relations across time steps and modalities are preserved via adaptive hyperedge construction. Empirical results on standard multimodal emotion benchmarks show that EC-Net produces robust, semantically coherent representations and consistently improves accuracy, particularly when modalities are partially available or contaminated by noise. These findings indicate that explicit hierarchical geometry combined with hypergraph fusion is effective for resilient multimodal affect understanding.]]></description>

Transformer-based single-object trackers achieve state-of-the-art accuracy but rely on fixed-depth inference, executing the full encoder--decoder stack for every frame regardless of visual complexity, thereby incurring unnecessary computational cost in long video sequences dominated by temporally coherent frames. We propose UncL-STARK, an architecture-preserving approach that enables dynamic, uncertainty-aware depth adaptation in transformer-based trackers without modifying the underlying network or adding auxiliary heads. The model is fine-tuned to retain predictive robustness at multiple intermediate depths using random-depth training with knowledge distillation, thus enabling safe inference-time truncation. At runtime, we derive a lightweight uncertainty estimate directly from the model's corner localization heatmaps and use it in a feedback-driven policy that selects the encoder and decoder depth for the next frame based on the prediction confidence by exploiting temporal coherence in video. Extensive experiments on GOT-10k and LaSOT demonstrate up to 12\% GFLOPs reduction, 8.9\% latency reduction, and 10.8\% energy savings while maintaining tracking accuracy within 0.2\% of the full-depth baseline across both short-term and long-term sequences.]]></description>

Real-world deployments routinely face distribution shifts, group imbalances, and adversarial perturbations, under which the traditional Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) framework can degrade severely.
  Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) addresses this issue by optimizing the worst-case expected loss over an uncertainty set of distributions, offering a principled approach to robustness.
  Meanwhile, as training data in DRO always involves sensitive information, safeguarding it against leakage under Differential Privacy (DP) is essential.
  In contrast to classical DP-ERM, DP-DRO has received much less attention due to its minimax optimization structure with uncertainty constraint.
  To bridge the gap, we provide a comprehensive study of DP-(finite-sum)-DRO with $ψ$-divergence and non-convex loss.
  First, we study DRO with general $ψ$-divergence by reformulating it as a minimization problem, and develop a novel $(\varepsilon, δ)$-DP optimization method, called DP Double-Spider, tailored to this structure.
  Under mild assumptions, we show that it achieves a utility bound of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+ (\frac{\sqrt{d \log (1/δ)}}{n \varepsilon})^{2/3})$ in terms of the gradient norm, where $n$ denotes the data size and $d$ denotes the model dimension.
  We further improve the utility rate for specific divergences.
  In particular, for DP-DRO with KL-divergence, by transforming the problem into a compositional finite-sum optimization problem, we develop a DP Recursive-Spider method and show that it achieves a utility bound of $\mathcal{O}((\frac{\sqrt{d \log(1/δ)}}{n\varepsilon})^{2/3} )$, matching the best-known result for non-convex DP-ERM.
  Experimentally, we demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform existing approaches for DP minimax optimization.]]></description>

Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning sometimes fails to faithfully reflect the true computation of a large language model (LLM), hampering its utility in explaining how LLMs arrive at their answers. Moreover, optimizing for faithfulness and interpretability in reasoning often degrades task performance. To address this tradeoff and improve CoT faithfulness, we propose Reasoning Execution by Multiple Listeners (REMUL), a multi-party reinforcement learning approach. REMUL builds on the hypothesis that reasoning traces which other parties can follow will be more faithful. A speaker model generates a reasoning trace, which is truncated and passed to a pool of listener models who "execute" the trace, continuing the trace to an answer. Speakers are rewarded for producing reasoning that is clear to listeners, with additional correctness regularization via masked supervised finetuning to counter the tradeoff between faithfulness and performance. On multiple reasoning benchmarks (BIG-Bench Extra Hard, MuSR, ZebraLogicBench, and FOLIO), REMUL consistently and substantially improves three measures of faithfulness -- hint attribution, early answering area over the curve (AOC), and mistake injection AOC -- while also improving accuracy. Our analysis finds that these gains are robust across training domains, translate to legibility gains, and are associated with shorter and more direct CoTs.]]></description>

Demographic bias in text-to-image (T2I) generation is well studied, yet demographic-conditioned failures in instruction-guided image-to-image (I2I) editing remain underexplored. We examine whether identical edit instructions yield systematically different outcomes across subject demographics in open-weight I2I editors. We formalize two failure modes: Soft Erasure, where edits are silently weakened or ignored in the output image, and Stereotype Replacement, where edits introduce unrequested, stereotype-consistent attributes. We introduce a controlled benchmark that probes demographic-conditioned behavior by generating and editing portraits conditioned on race, gender, and age using a diagnostic prompt set, and evaluate multiple editors with vision-language model (VLM) scoring and human evaluation. Our analysis shows that identity preservation failures are pervasive, demographically uneven, and shaped by implicit social priors, including occupation-driven gender inference. Finally, we demonstrate that a prompt-level identity constraint, without model updates, can substantially reduce demographic change for minority groups while leaving majority-group portraits largely unchanged, revealing asymmetric identity priors in current editors. Together, our findings establish identity preservation as a central and demographically uneven failure mode in I2I editing and motivate demographic-robust editing systems.

This paper is concerned with the distributed composite optimization problem over networks, where agents aim to minimize a sum of local smooth components and a common nonsmooth term. Leveraging the probabilistic local updates mechanism, we propose a communication-efficient Adapt-Then-Combine (ATC) framework, FlexATC, unifying numerous ATC-based distributed algorithms. Under stepsizes independent of the network topology and the number of local updates, we establish sublinear and linear convergence rates for FlexATC in convex and strongly convex settings, respectively. Remarkably, in the strong convex setting, the linear rate is decoupled from the objective functions and network topology, and FlexATC permits communication to be skipped in most iterations without any deterioration of the linear rate. In addition, the proposed unified theory demonstrates for the first time that local updates provably lead to communication acceleration for ATC-based distributed algorithms. Numerical experiments further validate the efficacy of the proposed framework and corroborate the theoretical results.]]></description>

Cross-subject generalization in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains challenging due to individual variability in neural signals. We investigate whether spectral representations offer more stable features for cross-subject transfer than temporal waveforms. Through correlation analyses across three EEG paradigms (SSVEP, P300, and Motor Imagery), we find that spectral features exhibit consistently higher cross-subject similarity than temporal signals. Motivated by this observation, we introduce ASPEN, a hybrid architecture that combines spectral and temporal feature streams via multiplicative fusion, requiring cross-modal agreement for features to propagate. Experiments across six benchmark datasets reveal that ASPEN is able to dynamically achieve the optimal spectral-temporal balance depending on the paradigm. ASPEN achieves the best unseen-subject accuracy on three of six datasets and competitive performance on others, demonstrating that multiplicative multimodal fusion enables effective cross-subject generalization.]]></description>

There are a number of existing studies analysing the convergence behaviour of graph neural networks on large random graphs. Unfortunately, the majority of these studies do not model correlations between node features, which would naturally exist in a variety of real-life networks. Consequently, the derived limitations of GNNs, resulting from such convergence behaviour, is not truly reflective of the expressive power of GNNs when applied to realistic graphs. In this paper, we will introduce a novel method to generate random graphs that have correlated node features. The node features will be sampled in such a manner to ensure correlation between neighbouring nodes. As motivation for our choice of sampling scheme, we will appeal to properties exhibited by real-life graphs, particularly properties that are captured by the Barabási-Albert model. A theoretical analysis will strongly indicate that convergence can be avoided in some cases, which we will empirically validate on large random graphs generated using our novel method. The observed divergent behaviour provides evidence that GNNs may be more expressive than initial studies would suggest, especially on realistic graphs.]]></description>

As multimodal systems increasingly process sensitive personal data, the ability to selectively revoke specific data modalities has become a critical requirement for privacy compliance and user autonomy. We present Missing-by-Design (MBD), a unified framework for revocable multimodal sentiment analysis that combines structured representation learning with a certifiable parameter-modification pipeline. Revocability is critical in privacy-sensitive applications where users or regulators may request removal of modality-specific information. MBD learns property-aware embeddings and employs generator-based reconstruction to recover missing channels while preserving task-relevant signals. For deletion requests, the framework applies saliency-driven candidate selection and a calibrated Gaussian update to produce a machine-verifiable Modality Deletion Certificate. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that MBD achieves strong predictive performance under incomplete inputs and delivers a practical privacy-utility trade-off, positioning surgical unlearning as an efficient alternative to full retraining.]]></description>

We study density estimation in Kullback-Leibler divergence: given an i.i.d. sample from an unknown density $p$, the goal is to construct an estimator $\widehat p$ such that $\mathrm{KL}(p,\widehat p)$ is small with high probability. We consider two settings involving a finite dictionary of $M$ densities: (i) model aggregation, where $p$ belongs to the dictionary, and (ii) convex aggregation (mixture density estimation), where $p$ is a mixture of densities from the dictionary. Crucially, we make no assumption on the base densities: their ratios may be unbounded and their supports may differ. For both problems, we identify the best possible high-probability guarantees in terms of the dictionary size, sample size, and confidence level. These optimal rates are higher than those achievable when density ratios are bounded by absolute constants; for mixture density estimation, they match existing lower bounds in the special case of discrete distributions.
  Our analysis of the mixture case hinges on two new covering results. First, we provide a sharp, distribution-free upper bound on the local Hellinger entropy of the class of mixtures of $M$ distributions. Second, we prove an optimal ratio covering theorem for convex sets: for every convex compact set $K\subset \mathbb{R}_+^d$, there exists a subset $A\subset K$ with at most $2^{8d}$ elements such that each element of $K$ is coordinate-wise dominated by an element of $A$ up to a universal constant factor. This geometric result is of independent interest; notably, it yields new cardinality estimates for $\varepsilon$-approximate Pareto sets in multi-objective optimization when the attainable set of objective vectors is convex.]]></description>

This study aimed to comprehend how user domain knowledge and artificial intelligence (AI) literacy impact the effective use of human-AI interactive building energy management system (BEMS). While prior studies have investigated the potential of integrating large language models (LLMs) into BEMS or building energy modeling, very few studies have examined how user interact with such systems. We conducted a systematic role-playing experiment, where 85 human subjects interacted with an advanced generative pre-trained transformer (OpenAI GPT-4o). Participants were tasked with identifying the top five behavioral changes that could reduce home energy use with the GPT model that functioned as an LLM-integrated BEMS. Then, the collected prompt-response data and participant conclusions were analyzed using an analytical framework that hierarchically assessed and scored human-AI interactions and their home energy analysis approaches. Also, participants were classified into four groups based on their self-evaluated domain knowledge of building energy use and AI literacy, and Kruskal-Wallis H tests with post-hoc pairwise comparisons were conducted across 20 quantifiable metrics. Key takeaways include: most participants employed concise prompts (median: 16.2 words) and relied heavily on GPT's analytical capabilities; and notably, only 1 of 20 metrics, appliance identification rate, showed statistically significant group differences (p=0.037), driven by AI literacy rather than domain knowledge, suggesting an equalizing effect of LLMs across expertise levels. This study provides foundational insights into human-AI collaboration dynamics and promising development directions in the context of LLM-integrated BEMS and contributes to realizing human-centric LLM-integrated energy systems.]]></description>

We introduce IRIS (Intent Resolution via Inference-time Saccades), a novel training-free approach that uses eye-tracking data in real-time to resolve ambiguity in open-ended VQA. Through a comprehensive user study with 500 unique image-question pairs, we demonstrate that fixations closest to the time participants start verbally asking their questions are the most informative for disambiguation in Large VLMs, more than doubling the accuracy of responses on ambiguous questions (from 35.2% to 77.2%) while maintaining performance on unambiguous queries. We evaluate our approach across state-of-the-art VLMs, showing consistent improvements when gaze data is incorporated in ambiguous image-question pairs, regardless of architectural differences. We release a new benchmark dataset to use eye movement data for disambiguated VQA, a novel real-time interactive protocol, and an evaluation suite.]]></description>

The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content on the Web presents a structural risk to information retrieval, as search engines and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems increasingly consume evidence produced by the Large Language Models (LLMs). We characterize this ecosystem-level failure mode as Retrieval Collapse, a two-stage process where (1) AI-generated content dominates search results, eroding source diversity, and (2) low-quality or adversarial content infiltrates the retrieval pipeline. We analyzed this dynamic through controlled experiments involving both high-quality SEO-style content and adversarially crafted content. In the SEO scenario, a 67\% pool contamination led to over 80\% exposure contamination, creating a homogenized yet deceptively healthy state where answer accuracy remains stable despite the reliance on synthetic sources. Conversely, under adversarial contamination, baselines like BM25 exposed $\sim$19\% of harmful content, whereas LLM-based rankers demonstrated stronger suppression capabilities. These findings highlight the risk of retrieval pipelines quietly shifting toward synthetic evidence and the need for retrieval-aware strategies to prevent a self-reinforcing cycle of quality decline in Web-grounded systems.]]></description>

Text-to-video diffusion models deliver impressive results but remain slow because of the sequential denoising of 3D latents. Existing approaches to speed up inference either require expensive model retraining or use heuristic-based step skipping, which struggles to maintain video quality as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our work, CHAI, aims to use cross-inference caching to reduce latency while maintaining video quality. We introduce Cache Attention as an effective method for attending to shared objects/scenes across cross-inference latents. This selective attention mechanism enables effective reuse of cached latents across semantically related prompts, yielding high cache hit rates. We show that it is possible to generate high-quality videos using Cache Attention with as few as 8 denoising steps. When integrated into the overall system, CHAI is 1.65x - 3.35x faster than baseline OpenSora 1.2 while maintaining video quality.]]></description>

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as agents to solve complex tasks such as question answering (QA), scientific debate, and software development. A standard evaluation procedure aggregates multiple responses from LLM agents into a single final answer, often via majority voting, and compares it against reference answers. However, this process can obscure the quality and distributional characteristics of the original responses. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation framework based on the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of cosine similarities between generated responses and reference answers. This enables a more nuanced assessment of response quality beyond exact match metrics. To analyze the response distributions across different agent configurations, we further introduce a clustering method for ECDFs using their distances and the $k$-medoids algorithm. Our experiments on a QA dataset demonstrate that ECDFs can distinguish between agent settings with similar final accuracies but different quality distributions. The clustering analysis also reveals interpretable group structures in the responses, offering insights into the impact of temperature, persona, and question topics.]]></description>

Learning with shared representation is widely recognized as an effective way to separate commonalities from heterogeneity across various heterogeneous sources. Most existing work includes all related data sources via simultaneously training a common feature extractor and source-specific heads. It is well understood that data sources with low relevance or poor quality may hinder representation learning. In this paper, we further dive into the question of which data sources should be learned jointly by focusing on the traditionally deemed ``good'' collection of sources, in which individual sources have similar relevance and qualities with respect to the true underlying common structure. Towards tractability, we focus on the linear setting where sources share a low-dimensional subspace. We find that source screening can play a central role in statistically optimal subspace estimation. We show that, for a broad class of problem instances, training on a carefully selected subset of sources suffices to achieve minimax optimality, even when a substantial portion of data is discarded. We formalize the notion of an informative subpopulation, develop algorithms and practical heuristics for identifying such subsets, and validate their effectiveness through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets.]]></description>

Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search is widely used in the retrieval stage of large-scale recommendation systems. In this stage, candidate items are indexed using their learned embedding vectors, and ANN search is executed for each user (or item) query to retrieve a set of relevant items. However, ANN-based retrieval has two key limitations. First, item embeddings and their indices are typically learned in separate stages: indexing is often performed offline after embeddings are trained, which can yield suboptimal retrieval quality-especially for newly created items. Second, although ANN offers sublinear query time, it must still be run for every request, incurring substantial computation cost at industry scale. In this paper, we propose MultiFaceted Learnable Index (MFLI), a scalable, real-time retrieval paradigm that learns multifaceted item embeddings and indices within a unified framework and eliminates ANN search at serving time. Specifically, we construct a multifaceted hierarchical codebook via residual quantization of item embeddings and co-train the codebook with the embeddings. We further introduce an efficient multifaceted indexing structure and mechanisms that support real-time updates. At serving time, the learned hierarchical indices are used directly to identify relevant items, avoiding ANN search altogether. Extensive experiments on real-world data with billions of users show that MFLI improves recall on engagement tasks by up to 11.8\%, cold-content delivery by up to 57.29\%, and semantic relevance by 13.5\% compared with prior state-of-the-art methods. We also deploy MFLI in the system and report online experimental results demonstrating improved engagement, less popularity bias, and higher serving efficiency.]]></description>

This paper introduces and demonstrates a computational pipeline for the statistical analysis of shape graph datasets, namely geometric networks embedded in 2D or 3D spaces. Unlike traditional abstract graphs, our purpose is not only to retrieve and distinguish variations in the connectivity structure of the data but also geometric differences of the network branches. Our proposed approach relies on the extraction of a specifically curated and explicit set of topological, geometric and directional features, designed to satisfy key invariance properties. We leverage the resulting feature representation for tasks such as group comparison, clustering and classification on cohorts of shape graphs. The effectiveness of this representation is evaluated on several real-world datasets including urban road/street networks, neuronal traces and astrocyte imaging. These results are benchmarked against several alternative methods, both feature-based and not.]]></description>

Large Language Models cannot reliably acquire new knowledge post-deployment -- even when relevant text resources exist, models fail to transform them into actionable knowledge without retraining. Retrieval-Augmented Generation attempts to bridge this gap by surfacing relevant documents at inference time, yet similarity-based retrieval often fails to identify context that actually improves task performance. We introduce Evolutionary Context Search (ECS), an evolutionary method that searches context combinations using accuracy on a small development set, requiring only inference calls without weight updates. ECS moves beyond semantic similarity to discover non-obvious context pairings that significantly boost performance. Our empirical results show that ECS improves BackendBench by 27\% and $τ$-bench airline by 7\%. The evolved contexts are model-agnostic, as those evolved with Gemini-3-Flash transfer effectively to Claude Sonnet and DeepSeek. This suggests that ECS opens a path toward automated context discovery for skill acquisition -- an efficient alternative to manual prompt engineering or costly fine-tuning.]]></description>

Online media platforms often need to measure how frequently users are exposed to specific content attributes in order to evaluate trade-offs in A/B experiments. A direct approach is to sample content, label it using a high-quality rubric (e.g., an expert-reviewed LLM prompt), and estimate impression-weighted prevalence. However, repeatedly running such labeling for every experiment arm and segment is too costly and slow to serve as a default measurement at scale.
  We present a scalable \emph{surrogate-based prevalence measurement} framework that decouples expensive labeling from per-experiment evaluation. The framework calibrates a surrogate signal to reference labels offline and then uses only impression logs to estimate prevalence for arbitrary experiment arms and segments. We instantiate this framework using \emph{score bucketing} as the surrogate: we discretize a model score into buckets, estimate bucket-level prevalences from an offline labeled sample, and combine these calibrated bucket level prevalences with the bucket distribution of impressions in each arm to obtain fast, log-based estimates.
  Across multiple large-scale A/B tests, we validate that the surrogate estimates closely match the reference estimates for both arm-level prevalence and treatment--control deltas. This enables scalable, low-latency prevalence measurement in experimentation without requiring per-experiment labeling jobs.]]></description>

Computed Tomography (CT) is one of the most widely used and diagnostically information-dense imaging modalities, covering critical organs such as the heart, lungs, liver, and colon. Clinical interpretation relies on both slice-driven local features (e.g., sub-centimeter nodules, lesion boundaries) and volume-driven spatial representations (e.g., tumor infiltration, inter-organ anatomical relations). However, existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain fragmented in CT slice versus volumetric understanding: slice-driven LVLMs show strong generalization but lack cross-slice spatial consistency, while volume-driven LVLMs explicitly capture volumetric semantics but suffer from coarse granularity and poor compatibility with slice inputs. The absence of a unified modeling paradigm constitutes a major bottleneck for the clinical translation of medical LVLMs. We present OmniCT, a powerful unified slice-volume LVLM for CT scenarios, which makes three contributions: (i) Spatial Consistency Enhancement (SCE): volumetric slice composition combined with tri-axial positional embedding that introduces volumetric consistency, and an MoE hybrid projection enables efficient slice-volume adaptation; (ii) Organ-level Semantic Enhancement (OSE): segmentation and ROI localization explicitly align anatomical regions, emphasizing lesion- and organ-level semantics; (iii) MedEval-CT: the largest slice-volume CT dataset and hybrid benchmark integrates comprehensive metrics for unified evaluation. OmniCT consistently outperforms existing methods with a substantial margin across diverse clinical tasks and satisfies both micro-level detail sensitivity and macro-level spatial reasoning. More importantly, it establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal medical imaging understanding.]]></description>

Cross-border insider threats pose a critical challenge to government financial schemes, particularly when dealing with distributed, privacy-sensitive data across multiple jurisdictions. Existing approaches face fundamental limitations: they cannot effectively share intelligence across borders due to privacy constraints, lack reasoning capabilities to understand complex multi-step attack patterns, and fail to capture intricate graph-structured relationships in financial networks. We introduce FedGraph-AGI, a novel federated learning framework integrating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) reasoning with graph neural networks for privacy-preserving cross-border insider threat detection. Our approach combines: (1) federated graph neural networks preserving data sovereignty; (2) Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) aggregation for heterogeneous jurisdictions; and (3) AGI-powered reasoning via Large Action Models (LAM) performing causal inference over graph data. Through experiments on a 50,000-transaction dataset across 10 jurisdictions, FedGraph-AGI achieves 92.3% accuracy, significantly outperforming federated baselines (86.1%) and centralized approaches (84.7%). Our ablation studies reveal AGI reasoning contributes 6.8% improvement, while MoE adds 4.4%. The system maintains epsilon = 1.0 differential privacy while achieving near-optimal performance and scales efficiently to 50+ clients. This represents the first integration of AGI reasoning with federated graph learning for insider threat detection, opening new directions for privacy-preserving cross-border intelligence sharing.]]></description>

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in applications that interact with the physical world, such as navigation, robotics, or mapping, making robust geospatial reasoning a critical capability. Despite that, LLMs' ability to reason about GPS coordinates and real-world geography remains underexplored. We introduce GPSBench, a dataset of 57,800 samples across 17 tasks for evaluating geospatial reasoning in LLMs, spanning geometric coordinate operations (e.g., distance and bearing computation) and reasoning that integrates coordinates with world knowledge. Focusing on intrinsic model capabilities rather than tool use, we evaluate 14 state-of-the-art LLMs and find that GPS reasoning remains challenging, with substantial variation across tasks: models are generally more reliable at real-world geographic reasoning than at geometric computations. Geographic knowledge degrades hierarchically, with strong country-level performance but weak city-level localization, while robustness to coordinate noise suggests genuine coordinate understanding rather than memorization. We further show that GPS-coordinate augmentation can improve in downstream geospatial tasks, and that finetuning induces trade-offs between gains in geometric computation and degradation in world knowledge.

Reliable and cost-effective maintenance is essential for railway safety, particularly at the wheel-rail interface, which is prone to wear and failure. Predictive maintenance frameworks increasingly leverage sensor-generated time-series data, yet traditional methods require manual feature engineering, and deep learning models often degrade in online settings with evolving operational patterns. This work presents a semantic-aware, label-efficient continual learning framework for railway fault diagnostics. Accelerometer signals are encoded via a Variational AutoEncoder into latent representations capturing the normal operational structure in a fully unsupervised manner. Importantly, semantic metadata, including axle counts, wheel indexes, and strain-based deformations, is extracted via AI-driven peak detection on fiber Bragg grating sensors (resistant to electromagnetic interference) and fused with the VAE embeddings, enhancing anomaly detection under unknown operational conditions. A lightweight gradient boosting supervised classifier stabilizes anomaly scoring with minimal labels, while a replay-based continual learning strategy enables adaptation to evolving domains without catastrophic forgetting. Experiments show the model detects minor imperfections due to flats and polygonization, while adapting to evolving operational conditions, such as changes in train type, speed, load, and track profiles, captured using a single accelerometer and strain gauge in wayside monitoring.]]></description>

LLM-powered agents are beginning to automate user's tasks across the open web, often with access to user resources such as emails and calendars. Unlike standard LLMs answering questions in a controlled ChatBot setting, web agents act "in the wild", interacting with third parties and leaving behind an action trace. Therefore, we ask the question: how do web agents handle user resources when accomplishing tasks on their behalf across live websites? In this paper, we formalize Natural Agentic Oversharing -- the unintentional disclosure of task-irrelevant user information through an agent trace of actions on the web. We introduce SPILLage, a framework that characterizes oversharing along two dimensions: channel (content vs. behavior) and directness (explicit vs. implicit). This taxonomy reveals a critical blind spot: while prior work focuses on text leakage, web agents also overshare behaviorally through clicks, scrolls, and navigation patterns that can be monitored. We benchmark 180 tasks on live e-commerce sites with ground-truth annotations separating task-relevant from task-irrelevant attributes. Across 1,080 runs spanning two agentic frameworks and three backbone LLMs, we demonstrate that oversharing is pervasive with behavioral oversharing dominates content oversharing by 5x. This effect persists -- and can even worsen -- under prompt-level mitigation. However, removing task-irrelevant information before execution improves task success by up to 17.9%, demonstrating that reducing oversharing improves task success. Our findings underscore that protecting privacy in web agents is a fundamental challenge, requiring a broader view of "output" that accounts for what agents do on the web, not just what they type. Our datasets and code are available at https://github.com/jrohsc/SPILLage.]]></description>
