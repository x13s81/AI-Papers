We introduce Solar Open, a 102B-parameter bilingual Mixture-of-Experts language model for underserved languages. Solar Open demonstrates a systematic methodology for building competitive LLMs by addressing three interconnected challenges. First, to train effectively despite data scarcity for underserved languages, we synthesize 4.5T tokens of high-quality, domain-specific, and RL-oriented data. Second, we coordinate this data through a progressive curriculum jointly optimizing composition, quality thresholds, and domain coverage across 20 trillion tokens. Third, to enable reasoning capabilities through scalable RL, we apply our proposed framework SnapPO for efficient optimization. Across benchmarks in English and Korean, Solar Open achieves competitive performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of this methodology for underserved language AI development.]]></description>

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have significantly advanced Computer-Using Agents (CUAs), current frameworks struggle with robustness in long-horizon workflows and generalization in novel domains. These limitations stem from a lack of granular control over historical visual context curation and the absence of visual-aware tutorial retrieval. To bridge these gaps, we introduce OS-Symphony, a holistic framework that comprises an Orchestrator coordinating two key innovations for robust automation: (1) a Reflection-Memory Agent that utilizes milestone-driven long-term memory to enable trajectory-level self-correction, effectively mitigating visual context loss in long-horizon tasks; (2) Versatile Tool Agents featuring a Multimodal Searcher that adopts a SeeAct paradigm to navigate a browser-based sandbox to synthesize live, visually aligned tutorials, thereby resolving fidelity issues in unseen scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that OS-Symphony delivers substantial performance gains across varying model scales, establishing new state-of-the-art results on three online benchmarks, notably achieving 65.84% on OSWorld.]]></description>

Autonomous agents based on large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving to handle multi-turn tasks, but ensuring their trustworthiness remains a critical challenge. A fundamental pillar of this trustworthiness is calibration, which refers to an agent's ability to express confidence that reliably reflects its actual performance. While calibration is well-established for static models, its dynamics in tool-integrated agentic workflows remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate verbalized calibration in tool-use agents, revealing a fundamental confidence dichotomy driven by tool type. Specifically, our pilot study identifies that evidence tools (e.g., web search) systematically induce severe overconfidence due to inherent noise in retrieved information, while verification tools (e.g., code interpreters) can ground reasoning through deterministic feedback and mitigate miscalibration. To robustly improve calibration across tool types, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning framework that jointly optimizes task accuracy and calibration, supported by a holistic benchmark of reward designs. We demonstrate that our trained agents not only achieve superior calibration but also exhibit robust generalization from local training environments to noisy web settings and to distinct domains such as mathematical reasoning. Our results highlight the necessity of domain-specific calibration strategies for tool-use agents. More broadly, this work establishes a foundation for building self-aware agents that can reliably communicate uncertainty in high-stakes, real-world deployments.]]></description>

Recent advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs) have set new standards in image generation, yet remain impractical for on-device deployment due to their high computational and memory costs. In this work, we present an efficient DiT framework tailored for mobile and edge devices that achieves transformer-level generation quality under strict resource constraints. Our design combines three key components. First, we propose a compact DiT architecture with an adaptive global-local sparse attention mechanism that balances global context modeling and local detail preservation. Second, we propose an elastic training framework that jointly optimizes sub-DiTs of varying capacities within a unified supernetwork, allowing a single model to dynamically adjust for efficient inference across different hardware. Finally, we develop Knowledge-Guided Distribution Matching Distillation, a step-distillation pipeline that integrates the DMD objective with knowledge transfer from few-step teacher models, producing high-fidelity and low-latency generation (e.g., 4-step) suitable for real-time on-device use. Together, these contributions enable scalable, efficient, and high-quality diffusion models for deployment on diverse hardware.]]></description>

Large Language Model (LLM) Agents exhibit inherent reasoning abilities through the collaboration of multiple tools. However, during agent inference, existing methods often suffer from (i) locally myopic generation, due to the absence of lookahead, and (ii) trajectory instability, where minor early errors can escalate into divergent reasoning paths. These issues make it difficult to balance global effectiveness and computational efficiency. To address these two issues, we propose meta-adaptive exploration with LLM agents https://github.com/exoskeletonzj/MAXS, a meta-adaptive reasoning framework based on LLM Agents that flexibly integrates tool execution and reasoning planning. MAXS employs a lookahead strategy to extend reasoning paths a few steps ahead, estimating the advantage value of tool usage, and combines step consistency variance and inter-step trend slopes to jointly select stable, consistent, and high-value reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a trajectory convergence mechanism that controls computational cost by halting further rollouts once path consistency is achieved, enabling a balance between resource efficiency and global effectiveness in multi-tool reasoning. We conduct extensive empirical studies across three base models (MiMo-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-32B) and five datasets, demonstrating that MAXS consistently outperforms existing methods in both performance and inference efficiency. Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of our lookahead strategy and tool usage.]]></description>

This paper presents VideoLoom, a unified Video Large Language Model (Video LLM) for joint spatial-temporal understanding. To facilitate the development of fine-grained spatial and temporal localization capabilities, we curate LoomData-8.7k, a human-centric video dataset with temporally grounded and spatially localized captions. With this, VideoLoom achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across a variety of spatial and temporal benchmarks (e.g., 63.1 J&F on ReVOS for referring video object segmentation, and 48.3 R1@0.7 on Charades-STA for temporal grounding). In addition, we introduce LoomBench, a novel benchmark consisting of temporal, spatial, and compositional video-question pairs, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of Video LLMs from diverse aspects. Collectively, these contributions offer a universal and effective suite for joint spatial-temporal video understanding, setting a new standard in multimodal intelligence.]]></description>

Improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) has largely relied on iterative self-training with model-generated data. While effective at boosting accuracy, existing approaches primarily reinforce successful reasoning paths, incurring a substantial calibration cost: models become overconfident and lose the ability to represent uncertainty. This failure has been characterized as a form of model collapse in alignment, where predictive distributions degenerate toward low-variance point estimates. We address this issue by reframing reasoning training as an epistemic learning problem, in which models must learn not only how to reason, but also when their reasoning should be trusted. We propose epistemically-calibrated reasoning (EpiCaR) as a training objective that jointly optimizes reasoning performance and calibration, and instantiate it within an iterative supervised fine-tuning framework using explicit self-evaluation signals. Experiments on Llama-3 and Qwen-3 families demonstrate that our approach achieves Pareto-superiority over standard baselines in both accuracy and calibration, particularly in models with sufficient reasoning capacity (e.g., 3B+). This framework generalizes effectively to OOD mathematical reasoning (GSM8K) and code generation (MBPP). Ultimately, our approach enables a 3X reduction in inference compute, matching the K=30 performance of STaR with only K=10 samples in capable models.]]></description>

As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve from static dialogue interfaces to autonomous general agents, effective memory is paramount to ensuring long-term consistency. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on casual conversation or task-oriented dialogue, failing to capture **"long-term project-oriented"** interactions where agents must track evolving goals.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce **RealMem**, the first benchmark grounded in realistic project scenarios. RealMem comprises over 2,000 cross-session dialogues across eleven scenarios, utilizing natural user queries for evaluation.
  We propose a synthesis pipeline that integrates Project Foundation Construction, Multi-Agent Dialogue Generation, and Memory and Schedule Management to simulate the dynamic evolution of memory. Experiments reveal that current memory systems face significant challenges in managing the long-term project states and dynamic context dependencies inherent in real-world projects.
  Our code and datasets are available at [https://github.com/AvatarMemory/RealMemBench](https://github.com/AvatarMemory/RealMemBench).]]></description>

Text-to-Visualization (Text2Vis) systems translate natural language queries over tabular data into concise answers and executable visualizations. While closed-source LLMs generate functional code, the resulting charts often lack semantic alignment and clarity, qualities that can only be assessed post-execution. Open-source models struggle even more, frequently producing non-executable or visually poor outputs. Although supervised fine-tuning can improve code executability, it fails to enhance overall visualization quality, as traditional SFT loss cannot capture post-execution feedback. To address this gap, we propose RL-Text2Vis, the first reinforcement learning framework for Text2Vis generation. Built on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our method uses a novel multi-objective reward that jointly optimizes textual accuracy, code validity, and visualization quality using post-execution feedback. By training Qwen2.5 models (7B and 14B), RL-Text2Vis achieves a 22% relative improvement in chart quality over GPT-4o on the Text2Vis benchmark and boosts code execution success from 78% to 97% relative to its zero-shot baseline. Our models significantly outperform strong zero-shot and supervised baselines and also demonstrate robust generalization to out-of-domain datasets like VIS-Eval and NVBench. These results establish GRPO as an effective strategy for structured, multimodal reasoning in visualization generation. We release our code at https://github.com/vis-nlp/RL-Text2Vis.]]></description>

Human beings primarily understand the world through concepts (e.g., dog), abstract mental representations that structure perception, reasoning, and learning. However, how large language models (LLMs) acquire, retain, and forget such concepts during continual pretraining remains poorly understood. In this work, we study how individual concepts are acquired and forgotten, as well as how multiple concepts interact through interference and synergy. We link these behavioral dynamics to LLMs' internal Concept Circuits, computational subgraphs associated with specific concepts, and incorporate Graph Metrics to characterize circuit structure. Our analysis reveals: (1) LLMs concept circuits provide a non-trivial, statistically significant signal of concept learning and forgetting; (2) Concept circuits exhibit a stage-wise temporal pattern during continual pretraining, with an early increase followed by gradual decrease and stabilization; (3) concepts with larger learning gains tend to exhibit greater forgetting under subsequent training; (4) semantically similar concepts induce stronger interference than weakly related ones; (5) conceptual knowledge differs in their transferability, with some significantly facilitating the learning of others. Together, our findings offer a circuit-level view of concept learning dynamics and inform the design of more interpretable and robust concept-aware training strategies for LLMs.]]></description>

Deterministic inference is a comforting ideal in classical software: the same program on the same input should always produce the same output. As large language models move into real-world deployment, this ideal has been imported wholesale into inference stacks. Recent work from the Thinking Machines Lab has presented a detailed analysis of nondeterminism in LLM inference, showing how batch-invariant kernels and deterministic attention can enforce bitwise-identical outputs, positioning deterministic inference as a prerequisite for reproducibility and enterprise reliability.
  In this paper, we take the opposite stance. We argue that, for LLMs, deterministic inference kills. It kills the ability to model uncertainty, suppresses emergent abilities, collapses reasoning into a single brittle path, and weakens safety alignment by hiding tail risks. LLMs implement conditional distributions over outputs, not fixed functions. Collapsing these distributions to a single canonical completion may appear reassuring, but it systematically conceals properties central to artificial cognition. We instead advocate Stochastic CHAOS, treating distributional variability as a signal to be measured and controlled.
  Empirically, we show that deterministic inference is systematically misleading. Single-sample deterministic evaluation underestimates both capability and fragility, masking failure probability under paraphrases and noise. Phase-like transitions associated with emergent abilities disappear under greedy decoding. Multi-path reasoning degrades when forced onto deterministic backbones, reducing accuracy and diagnostic insight. Finally, deterministic evaluation underestimates safety risk by hiding rare but dangerous behaviors that appear only under multi-sample evaluation.]]></description>

Designing a unified neural network to efficiently and inherently process sequential data with arbitrary lengths is a central and challenging problem in sequence modeling. The design choices in Transformer, including quadratic complexity and weak length extrapolation, have limited their ability to scale to long sequences. In this work, we propose Gecko, a neural architecture that inherits the design of Mega and Megalodon (exponential moving average with gated attention), and further introduces multiple technical components to improve its capability to capture long range dependencies, including timestep decay normalization, sliding chunk attention mechanism, and adaptive working memory. In a controlled pretraining comparison with Llama2 and Megalodon in the scale of 7 billion parameters and 2 trillion training tokens, Gecko achieves better efficiency and long-context scalability. Gecko reaches a training loss of 1.68, significantly outperforming Llama2-7B (1.75) and Megalodon-7B (1.70), and landing close to Llama2-13B (1.67). Notably, without relying on any context-extension techniques, Gecko exhibits inherent long-context processing and retrieval capabilities, stably handling sequences of up to 4 million tokens and retrieving information from contexts up to 4times longer than its attention window.

While autonomous software engineering (SWE) agents are reshaping programming paradigms, they currently suffer from a "closed-world" limitation: they attempt to fix bugs from scratch or solely using local context, ignoring the immense historical human experience available on platforms like GitHub. Accessing this open-world experience is hindered by the unstructured and fragmented nature of real-world issue-tracking data. In this paper, we introduce MemGovern, a framework designed to govern and transform raw GitHub data into actionable experiential memory for agents. MemGovern employs experience governance to convert human experience into agent-friendly experience cards and introduces an agentic experience search strategy that enables logic-driven retrieval of human expertise. By producing 135K governed experience cards, MemGovern achieves a significant performance boost, improving resolution rates on the SWE-bench Verified by 4.65%. As a plug-in approach, MemGovern provides a solution for agent-friendly memory infrastructure.]]></description>

Complex reasoning in tool-augmented agent frameworks is inherently long-horizon, causing reasoning traces and transient tool artifacts to accumulate and strain the bounded working context of large language models. Without explicit memory mechanisms, such accumulation disrupts logical continuity and undermines task alignment. This positions memory not as an auxiliary efficiency concern, but as a core component for sustaining coherent, goal-directed reasoning over long horizons.
  We propose MemoBrain, an executive memory model for tool-augmented agents that constructs a dependency-aware memory over reasoning steps, capturing salient intermediate states and their logical relations. Operating as a co-pilot alongside the reasoning agent, MemoBrain organizes reasoning progress without blocking execution and actively manages the working context. Specifically, it prunes invalid steps, folds completed sub-trajectories, and preserves a compact, high-salience reasoning backbone under a fixed context budget. Together, these mechanisms enable explicit cognitive control over reasoning trajectories rather than passive context accumulation.
  We evaluate MemoBrain on challenging long-horizon benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalker, and BrowseComp-Plus, demonstrating consistent improvements over strong baselines.]]></description>

Video object segmentation methods like SAM2 achieve strong performance through memory-based architectures but struggle under large viewpoint changes due to reliance on appearance features. Traditional 3D instance segmentation methods address viewpoint consistency but require camera poses, depth maps, and expensive preprocessing. We introduce 3AM, a training-time enhancement that integrates 3D-aware features from MUSt3R into SAM2. Our lightweight Feature Merger fuses multi-level MUSt3R features that encode implicit geometric correspondence. Combined with SAM2's appearance features, the model achieves geometry-consistent recognition grounded in both spatial position and visual similarity. We propose a field-of-view aware sampling strategy ensuring frames observe spatially consistent object regions for reliable 3D correspondence learning. Critically, our method requires only RGB input at inference, with no camera poses or preprocessing. On challenging datasets with wide-baseline motion (ScanNet++, Replica), 3AM substantially outperforms SAM2 and extensions, achieving 90.6% IoU and 71.7% Positive IoU on ScanNet++'s Selected Subset, improving over state-of-the-art VOS methods by +15.9 and +30.4 points.

Despite the rapid progress of video generation models, the role of data in influencing motion is poorly understood. We present Motive (MOTIon attribution for Video gEneration), a motion-centric, gradient-based data attribution framework that scales to modern, large, high-quality video datasets and models. We use this to study which fine-tuning clips improve or degrade temporal dynamics. Motive isolates temporal dynamics from static appearance via motion-weighted loss masks, yielding efficient and scalable motion-specific influence computation. On text-to-video models, Motive identifies clips that strongly affect motion and guides data curation that improves temporal consistency and physical plausibility. With Motive-selected high-influence data, our method improves both motion smoothness and dynamic degree on VBench, achieving a 74.1% human preference win rate compared with the pretrained base model. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to attribute motion rather than visual appearance in video generative models and to use it to curate fine-tuning data.]]></description>

Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a promising alternative for language modeling by enabling parallel decoding through iterative refinement. However, most DLMs rely on hard binary masking and discrete token assignments, which hinder the revision of early decisions and underutilize intermediate probabilistic representations. In this paper, we propose EvoToken-DLM, a novel diffusion-based language modeling approach that replaces hard binary masks with evolving soft token distributions. EvoToken-DLM enables a progressive transition from masked states to discrete outputs, supporting revisable decoding. To effectively support this evolution, we introduce continuous trajectory supervision, which aligns training objectives with iterative probabilistic updates. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that EvoToken-DLM consistently achieves superior performance, outperforming strong diffusion-based and masked DLM baselines.

Video generation models, as one form of world models, have emerged as one of the most exciting frontiers in AI, promising agents the ability to imagine the future by modeling the temporal evolution of complex scenes. In autonomous driving, this vision gives rise to driving world models: generative simulators that imagine ego and agent futures, enabling scalable simulation, safe testing of corner cases, and rich synthetic data generation. Yet, despite fast-growing research activity, the field lacks a rigorous benchmark to measure progress and guide priorities. Existing evaluations remain limited: generic video metrics overlook safety-critical imaging factors; trajectory plausibility is rarely quantified; temporal and agent-level consistency is neglected; and controllability with respect to ego conditioning is ignored. Moreover, current datasets fail to cover the diversity of conditions required for real-world deployment. To address these gaps, we present DrivingGen, the first comprehensive benchmark for generative driving world models. DrivingGen combines a diverse evaluation dataset curated from both driving datasets and internet-scale video sources, spanning varied weather, time of day, geographic regions, and complex maneuvers, with a suite of new metrics that jointly assess visual realism, trajectory plausibility, temporal coherence, and controllability. Benchmarking 14 state-of-the-art models reveals clear trade-offs: general models look better but break physics, while driving-specific ones capture motion realistically but lag in visual quality. DrivingGen offers a unified evaluation framework to foster reliable, controllable, and deployable driving world models, enabling scalable simulation, planning, and data-driven decision-making.]]></description>

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) tasks require reasoning over complex visual scenes and executing adaptive actions in dynamic environments. While recent studies on reasoning VLAs show that explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) can improve generalization, they suffer from high inference latency due to lengthy reasoning traces. We propose Fast-ThinkAct, an efficient reasoning framework that achieves compact yet performant planning through verbalizable latent reasoning. Fast-ThinkAct learns to reason efficiently with latent CoTs by distilling from a teacher, driven by a preference-guided objective to align manipulation trajectories that transfers both linguistic and visual planning capabilities for embodied control. This enables reasoning-enhanced policy learning that effectively connects compact reasoning to action execution. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied manipulation and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-ThinkAct achieves strong performance with up to 89.3\% reduced inference latency over state-of-the-art reasoning VLAs, while maintaining effective long-horizon planning, few-shot adaptation, and failure recovery.]]></description>

VLA models have shown promising potential in embodied navigation by unifying perception and planning while inheriting the strong generalization abilities of large VLMs. However, most existing VLA models rely on reactive mappings directly from observations to actions, lacking the explicit reasoning capabilities and persistent memory required for complex, long-horizon navigation tasks. To address these challenges, we propose VLingNav, a VLA model for embodied navigation grounded in linguistic-driven cognition. First, inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition, we introduce an adaptive chain-of-thought mechanism, which dynamically triggers explicit reasoning only when necessary, enabling the agent to fluidly switch between fast, intuitive execution and slow, deliberate planning. Second, to handle long-horizon spatial dependencies, we develop a visual-assisted linguistic memory module that constructs a persistent, cross-modal semantic memory, enabling the agent to recall past observations to prevent repetitive exploration and infer movement trends for dynamic environments. For the training recipe, we construct Nav-AdaCoT-2.9M, the largest embodied navigation dataset with reasoning annotations to date, enriched with adaptive CoT annotations that induce a reasoning paradigm capable of adjusting both when to think and what to think about. Moreover, we incorporate an online expert-guided reinforcement learning stage, enabling the model to surpass pure imitation learning and to acquire more robust, self-explored navigation behaviors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VLingNav achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of embodied navigation benchmarks. Notably, VLingNav transfers to real-world robotic platforms in a zero-shot manner, executing various navigation tasks and demonstrating strong cross-domain and cross-task generalization.]]></description>

Self-evolution methods enhance code generation through iterative "generate-verify-refine" cycles, yet existing approaches suffer from low exploration efficiency, failing to discover solutions with superior complexity within limited budgets. This inefficiency stems from initialization bias trapping evolution in poor solution regions, uncontrolled stochastic operations lacking feedback guidance, and insufficient experience utilization across tasks. To address these bottlenecks, we propose Controlled Self-Evolution (CSE), which consists of three key components. Diversified Planning Initialization generates structurally distinct algorithmic strategies for broad solution space coverage. Genetic Evolution replaces stochastic operations with feedback-guided mechanisms, enabling targeted mutation and compositional crossover. Hierarchical Evolution Memory captures both successful and failed experiences at inter-task and intra-task levels. Experiments on EffiBench-X demonstrate that CSE consistently outperforms all baselines across various LLM backbones. Furthermore, CSE achieves higher efficiency from early generations and maintains continuous improvement throughout evolution. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/EvoControl.]]></description>

Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a standard paradigm for reasoning in Large Language Models. However, optimizing solely for final-answer correctness often drives models into aimless, verbose exploration, where they rely on exhaustive trial-and-error tactics rather than structured planning to reach solutions. While heuristic constraints like length penalties can reduce verbosity, they often truncate essential reasoning steps, creating a difficult trade-off between efficiency and verification. In this paper, we argue that discriminative capability is a prerequisite for efficient generation: by learning to distinguish valid solutions, a model can internalize a guidance signal that prunes the search space. We propose JudgeRLVR, a two-stage judge-then-generate paradigm. In the first stage, we train the model to judge solution responses with verifiable answers. In the second stage, we fine-tune the same model with vanilla generating RLVR initialized from the judge. Compared to Vanilla RLVR using the same math-domain training data, JudgeRLVR achieves a better quality--efficiency trade-off for Qwen3-30B-A3B: on in-domain math, it delivers about +3.7 points average accuracy gain with -42\% average generation length; on out-of-domain benchmarks, it delivers about +4.5 points average accuracy improvement, demonstrating enhanced generalization.]]></description>

Discrete motion tokenization has recently enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to serve as versatile backbones for motion understanding and motion-language reasoning. However, existing pipelines typically decouple motion quantization from semantic embedding learning, linking them solely via token IDs. This approach fails to effectively align the intrinsic geometry of the motion space with the embedding space, thereby hindering the LLM's capacity for nuanced motion reasoning. We argue that alignment is most effective when both modalities share a unified geometric basis. Therefore, instead of forcing the LLM to reconstruct the complex geometry among motion tokens from scratch, we present a novel framework that explicitly enforces orthogonality on both the motion codebook and the LLM embedding space, ensuring that their relational structures naturally mirror each other. Specifically, we employ a decoder-only quantizer with Gumbel-Softmax for differentiable training and balanced codebook usage. To bridge the modalities, we use a sparse projection that maps motion codes into the LLM embedding space while preserving orthogonality. Finally, a two-stage orthonormal regularization schedule enforces soft constraints during tokenizer training and LLM fine-tuning to maintain geometric alignment without hindering semantic adaptation. Extensive experiments on HumanML3D demonstrate that our framework achieves a 20% performance improvement over current state-of-the-art methods, validating that a unified geometric basis effectively empowers the LLM for nuanced motion reasoning.]]></description>

Non-compositional expressions (e.g., idioms, proverbs, and metaphors) pose significant challenges for neural machine translation systems because their meanings cannot be derived from individual words alone. These expressions encode rich, cultural meaning, and have both figurative and literal meanings, making accurate translation difficult. Because models are fairly good at translating compositional text, we investigate GRPO-style fine-tuning using Machine Translation Quality Estimation (MTQE) models as reward functions to train models to better translate idioms. Using Chinese and Hindi idiom datasets, we find that idiom translation abilities improve by ~14 points, general, non-idiomatic translation implicitly improves by ~8 points, and cross-lingual translation abilities (trained on one language, evaluated on another) improves by ~6 points. Overall, our work quantifies the non-compositional translation gap and offers insights for developing LLMs with stronger cross-cultural and figurative language understanding.]]></description>

The recent paradigm shift toward large reasoning models (LRMs) as autonomous agents has intensified the demand for sophisticated, multi-turn tool-use capabilities. Yet, existing datasets and data-generation approaches are limited by static, predefined toolsets that cannot scale to the complexity of open-ended human-agent collaboration. To address this, we initially developed a framework for automated task-oriented multi-turn dialogue generation at scale, utilizing an LRM-based simulator to dynamically generate high-value, domain-specific tools to solve specified tasks. However, we observe that a purely task-oriented design often results in "solely task-solving" trajectories, where the agent completes the objective with minimal interaction, failing to generate the high turn-count conversations seen in realistic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we shift toward a user-oriented simulation paradigm. By decoupling task generation from a dedicated user simulator that mimics human behavioral rules - such as incremental request-making and turn-by-turn feedback - we facilitate more authentic, extended multi-turn dialogues that reflect the iterative nature of real-world problem solving. Our generation pipeline operates as a versatile, plug-and-play module capable of initiating generation from any state, ensuring high scalability in producing extended tool-use data. Furthermore, by facilitating multiple task completions within a single trajectory, it yields a high-density dataset that reflects the multifaceted demands of real-world human-agent interaction.]]></description>

While the Transformer architecture dominates many fields, its quadratic self-attention complexity hinders its use in large-scale applications. Linear attention offers an efficient alternative, but its direct application often degrades performance, with existing fixes typically re-introducing computational overhead through extra modules (e.g., depthwise separable convolution) that defeat the original purpose. In this work, we identify a key failure mode in these methods: global context collapse, where the model loses representational diversity. To address this, we propose Multi-Head Linear Attention (MHLA), which preserves this diversity by computing attention within divided heads along the token dimension. We prove that MHLA maintains linear complexity while recovering much of the expressive power of softmax attention, and verify its effectiveness across multiple domains, achieving a 3.6\% improvement on ImageNet classification, a 6.3\% gain on NLP, a 12.6\% improvement on image generation, and a 41\% enhancement on video generation under the same time complexity.]]></description>

Reinforcement learning has substantially improved the performance of LLM agents on tasks with verifiable outcomes, but it still struggles on open-ended agent tasks with vast solution spaces (e.g., complex travel planning). Due to the absence of objective ground-truth for these tasks, current RL algorithms largely rely on reward models that assign scalar scores to individual responses. We contend that such pointwise scoring suffers from an inherent discrimination collapse: the reward model struggles to distinguish subtle advantages among different trajectories, resulting in scores within a group being compressed into a narrow range. Consequently, the effective reward signal becomes dominated by noise from the reward model, leading to optimization stagnation. To address this, we propose ArenaRL, a reinforcement learning paradigm that shifts from pointwise scalar scoring to intra-group relative ranking. ArenaRL introduces a process-aware pairwise evaluation mechanism, employing multi-level rubrics to assign fine-grained relative scores to trajectories. Additionally, we construct an intra-group adversarial arena and devise a tournament-based ranking scheme to obtain stable advantage signals. Empirical results confirm that the built seeded single-elimination scheme achieves nearly equivalent advantage estimation accuracy to full pairwise comparisons with O(N^2) complexity, while operating with only O(N) complexity, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and precision. Furthermore, to address the lack of full-cycle benchmarks for open-ended agents, we build Open-Travel and Open-DeepResearch, two high-quality benchmarks featuring a comprehensive pipeline covering SFT, RL training, and multi-dimensional evaluation. Extensive experiments show that ArenaRL substantially outperforms standard RL baselines, enabling LLM agents to generate more robust solutions for complex real-world tasks.]]></description>

Retrieval Augmented Generation faces a trade-off: concatenating documents in a long prompt enables multi-document reasoning but creates prefill bottlenecks, while encoding document KV caches separately offers speed but breaks cross-document interaction. We propose Parallel Context-of-Experts Decoding (Pced), a training-free framework that shifts evidence aggregation from the attention mechanism to the decoding. Pced treats retrieved documents as isolated "experts", synchronizing their predictions via a novel retrieval-aware contrastive decoding rule that weighs expert logits against the model prior. This approach recovers cross-document reasoning capabilities without constructing a shared attention across documents.]]></description>

While Chain-of-Thought empowers Large Vision-Language Models with multi-step reasoning, explicit textual rationales suffer from an information bandwidth bottleneck, where continuous visual details are discarded during discrete tokenization. Recent latent reasoning methods attempt to address this challenge, but often fall prey to premature semantic collapse due to rigid autoregressive objectives. In this paper, we propose Laser, a novel paradigm that reformulates visual deduction via Dynamic Windowed Alignment Learning (DWAL). Instead of forcing a point-wise prediction, Laser aligns the latent state with a dynamic validity window of future semantics. This mechanism enforces a "Forest-before-Trees" cognitive hierarchy, enabling the model to maintain a probabilistic superposition of global features before narrowing down to local details. Crucially, Laser maintains interpretability via decodable trajectories while stabilizing unconstrained learning via Self-Refined Superposition. Extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks demonstrate that Laser achieves state-of-the-art performance among latent reasoning methods, surpassing the strong baseline Monet by 5.03% on average. Notably, it achieves these gains with extreme efficiency, reducing inference tokens by more than 97%, while demonstrating robust generalization to out-of-distribution domains.]]></description>

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines must address challenges beyond simple single-document retrieval, such as interpreting visual elements (tables, charts, images), synthesizing information across documents, and providing accurate source grounding. Existing benchmarks fail to capture this complexity, often focusing on textual data, single-document comprehension, or evaluating retrieval and generation in isolation. We introduce ViDoRe v3, a comprehensive multimodal RAG benchmark featuring multi-type queries over visually rich document corpora. It covers 10 datasets across diverse professional domains, comprising ~26,000 document pages paired with 3,099 human-verified queries, each available in 6 languages. Through 12,000 hours of human annotation effort, we provide high-quality annotations for retrieval relevance, bounding box localization, and verified reference answers. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art RAG pipelines reveals that visual retrievers outperform textual ones, late-interaction models and textual reranking substantially improve performance, and hybrid or purely visual contexts enhance answer generation quality. However, current models still struggle with non-textual elements, open-ended queries, and fine-grained visual grounding. To encourage progress in addressing these challenges, the benchmark is released under a commercially permissive license at https://hf.co/vidore.]]></description>

Scientific reasoning relies not only on logical inference but also on activating prior knowledge and experiential structures. Memory can efficiently reuse knowledge and enhance reasoning consistency and stability. However, existing benchmarks mainly evaluate final answers or step-by-step coherence, overlooking the memory-driven mechanisms that underlie human reasoning, which involves activating anchors and attractors, then integrating them into multi-step inference. To address this gap, we propose A^3-Bench~ https://a3-bench.github.io, a benchmark designed to evaluate scientific reasoning through dual-scale memory-driven activation, grounded in Anchor and Attractor Activation. First, we annotate 2,198 science reasoning problems across domains using the SAPM process(subject, anchor & attractor, problem, and memory developing). Second, we introduce a dual-scale memory evaluation framework utilizing anchors and attractors, along with the AAUI(Anchor--Attractor Utilization Index) metric to measure memory activation rates. Finally, through experiments with various base models and paradigms, we validate A^3-Bench and analyze how memory activation impacts reasoning performance, providing insights into memory-driven scientific reasoning.]]></description>

Controllable video character replacement with a user-provided identity remains a challenging problem due to the lack of paired video data. Prior works have predominantly relied on a reconstruction-based paradigm that requires per-frame segmentation masks and explicit structural guidance (e.g., skeleton, depth). This reliance, however, severely limits their generalizability in complex scenarios involving occlusions, character-object interactions, unusual poses, or challenging illumination, often leading to visual artifacts and temporal inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose MoCha, a pioneering framework that bypasses these limitations by requiring only a single arbitrary frame mask. To effectively adapt the multi-modal input condition and enhance facial identity, we introduce a condition-aware RoPE and employ an RL-based post-training stage. Furthermore, to overcome the scarcity of qualified paired-training data, we propose a comprehensive data construction pipeline. Specifically, we design three specialized datasets: a high-fidelity rendered dataset built with Unreal Engine 5 (UE5), an expression-driven dataset synthesized by current portrait animation techniques, and an augmented dataset derived from existing video-mask pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. We will release the code to facilitate further research.

Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce surprisingly sophisticated estimates of their own uncertainty. However, it remains unclear to what extent this expressed confidence is tied to the reasoning, knowledge, or decision making of the model. To test this, we introduce RiskEval: a framework designed to evaluate whether models adjust their abstention policies in response to varying error penalties. Our evaluation of several frontier models reveals a critical dissociation: models are neither cost-aware when articulating their verbal confidence, nor strategically responsive when deciding whether to engage or abstain under high-penalty conditions. Even when extreme penalties render frequent abstention the mathematically optimal strategy, models almost never abstain, resulting in utility collapse. This indicates that calibrated verbal confidence scores may not be sufficient to create trustworthy and interpretable AI systems, as current models lack the strategic agency to convert uncertainty signals into optimal and risk-sensitive decisions.]]></description>

The rapid evolution of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has advanced workflow automation; however, existing research mainly targets performance upper bounds in static environments, overlooking robustness for stochastic real-world deployment. We identify three key challenges: dynamic task scheduling, active exploration under uncertainty, and continuous learning from experience. To bridge this gap, we introduce , a dynamic evaluation environment that simulates a "trainee" agent continuously exploring a novel setting. Unlike traditional benchmarks,  evaluates agents along three dimensions: (1) context-aware scheduling for streaming tasks with varying priorities; (2) prudent information acquisition to reduce hallucination via active exploration; and (3) continuous evolution by distilling generalized strategies from rule-based, dynamically generated tasks. Experiments show that cutting-edge agents have significant deficiencies in dynamic environments, especially in active exploration and continual learning. Our work establishes a framework for assessing agent reliability, shifting evaluation from static tests to realistic, production-oriented scenarios.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world fact-checking systems, yet existing evaluations focus predominantly on claim verification and overlook the broader fact-checking workflow, including claim extraction and evidence retrieval. This narrow focus prevents current benchmarks from revealing systematic reasoning failures, factual blind spots, and robustness limitations of modern LLMs. To bridge this gap, we present FactArena, a fully automated arena-style evaluation framework that conducts comprehensive, stage-wise benchmarking of LLMs across the complete fact-checking pipeline. FactArena integrates three key components: (i) an LLM-driven fact-checking process that standardizes claim decomposition, evidence retrieval via tool-augmented interactions, and justification-based verdict prediction; (ii) an arena-styled judgment mechanism guided by consolidated reference guidelines to ensure unbiased and consistent pairwise comparisons across heterogeneous judge agents; and (iii) an arena-driven claim-evolution module that adaptively generates more challenging and semantically controlled claims to probe LLMs' factual robustness beyond fixed seed data. Across 16 state-of-the-art LLMs spanning seven model families, FactArena produces stable and interpretable rankings. Our analyses further reveal significant discrepancies between static claim-verification accuracy and end-to-end fact-checking competence, highlighting the necessity of holistic evaluation. The proposed framework offers a scalable and trustworthy paradigm for diagnosing LLMs' factual reasoning, guiding future model development, and advancing the reliable deployment of LLMs in safety-critical fact-checking applications.]]></description>

Post-training of large language models routinely interleaves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL). These two methods have different objectives: SFT minimizes the cross-entropy loss between model outputs and expert responses, while RL maximizes reward signals derived from human preferences or rule-based verifiers. Modern reasoning models have widely adopted the practice of alternating SFT and RL training. However, there is no theoretical account of whether they can be decoupled. We prove that decoupling is impossible in either order: (1) SFT-then-RL coupling: RL increases SFT loss under SFT optimality and (2) RL-then-SFT coupling: SFT lowers the reward achieved by RL. Experiments on Qwen3-0.6B confirm the predicted degradation, verifying that SFT and RL cannot be separated without loss of prior performance in the post-training]]></description>

Large language models (LLMs) can be adapted to new tasks using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods that modify only a small number of trainable parameters, often through low-rank updates. In this work, we adopt a quantum-information-inspired perspective to understand their effectiveness. From this perspective, low-rank parameterizations naturally correspond to low-dimensional Matrix Product States (MPS) representations, which enable entanglement-based characterizations of parameter structure. Thereby, we term and measure "Artificial Entanglement", defined as the entanglement entropy of the parameters in artificial neural networks (in particular the LLMs). We first study the representative low-rank adaptation (LoRA) PEFT method, alongside full fine-tuning (FFT), using LLaMA models at the 1B and 8B scales trained on the Tulu3 and OpenThoughts3 datasets, and uncover: (i) Internal artificial entanglement in the updates of query and value projection matrices in LoRA follows a volume law with a central suppression (termed as the "Entanglement Valley"), which is sensitive to hyper-parameters and is distinct from that in FFT; (ii) External artificial entanglement in attention matrices, corresponding to token-token correlations in representation space, follows an area law with logarithmic corrections and remains robust to LoRA hyper-parameters and training steps. Drawing a parallel to the No-Hair Theorem in black hole physics, we propose that although LoRA and FFT induce distinct internal entanglement signatures, such differences do not manifest in the attention outputs, suggesting a "no-hair" property that results in the effectiveness of low rank updates. We further provide theoretical support based on random matrix theory, and extend our analysis to an MPS Adaptation PEFT method, which exhibits qualitatively similar behaviors.]]></description>

Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong general-purpose capabilities, yet still struggle on Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC), a core perception task that requires subtle visual discrimination and is crucial for many real-world applications. A widely adopted strategy for boosting performance on challenging tasks such as math and coding is Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, several prior works have reported that CoT can actually harm performance on visual perception tasks. These studies, though, examine the issue from relatively narrow angles and leave open why CoT degrades perception-heavy performance. We systematically re-examine the role of CoT in FGVC through the lenses of zero-shot evaluation and multiple training paradigms. Across these settings, we uncover a central paradox: the degradation induced by CoT is largely driven by the reasoning length, in which longer textual reasoning consistently lowers classification accuracy. We term this phenomenon the ``Cost of Thinking''. Building on this finding, we make two key contributions: (1) \alg, a simple and general plug-and-play normalization method for multi-reward optimization that balances heterogeneous reward signals, and (2) ReFine-RFT, a framework that combines ensemble rewards with \alg to constrain reasoning length while providing dense accuracy-oriented feedback. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our findings and the proposed ReFine-RFT, achieving state-of-the-art performance across FGVC benchmarks. Code and models are available at https://github.com/jiezhu23/ReFine-RFT{Project Link}.]]></description>

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in close proximity to humans for applications such as parcel delivery, traffic monitoring, disaster response and infrastructure inspections. Ensuring safe and reliable operation in these human-populated environments demands accurate perception of human poses and actions from an aerial viewpoint. This perspective challenges existing methods with low resolution, steep viewing angles and (self-)occlusion, especially if the application demands realtime feasibile models. We train and deploy FlyPose, a lightweight top-down human pose estimation pipeline for aerial imagery. Through multi-dataset training, we achieve an average improvement of 6.8 mAP in person detection across the test-sets of Manipal-UAV, VisDrone, HIT-UAV as well as our custom dataset. For 2D human pose estimation we report an improvement of 16.3 mAP on the challenging UAV-Human dataset. FlyPose runs with an inference latency of ~20 milliseconds including preprocessing on a Jetson Orin AGX Developer Kit and is deployed onboard a quadrotor UAV during flight experiments. We also publish FlyPose-104, a small but challenging aerial human pose estimation dataset, that includes manual annotations from difficult aerial perspectives: https://github.com/farooqhassaan/FlyPose.]]></description>

Existing long-horizon memory benchmarks mostly use multi-turn dialogues or synthetic user histories, which makes retrieval performance an imperfect proxy for person understanding. We present \BenchName, a publicly releasable benchmark built from long-form autobiographical narratives, where actions, context, and inner thoughts provide dense evidence for inferring stable motivations and decision principles. \BenchName~reconstructs each narrative into a flashback-aware, time-anchored stream and evaluates models with evidence-linked questions spanning factual recall, subjective state attribution, and principle-level reasoning. Across diverse narrative sources, retrieval-augmented systems mainly improve factual accuracy, while errors persist on temporally grounded explanations and higher-level inferences, highlighting the need for memory mechanisms beyond retrieval. Our data is in KnowMeBench{https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/KnowMeBench}.]]></description>

We introduce the Ministral 3 series, a family of parameter-efficient dense language models designed for compute and memory constrained applications, available in three model sizes: 3B, 8B, and 14B parameters. For each model size, we release three variants: a pretrained base model for general-purpose use, an instruction finetuned, and a reasoning model for complex problem-solving. In addition, we present our recipe to derive the Ministral 3 models through Cascade Distillation, an iterative pruning and continued training with distillation technique. Each model comes with image understanding capabilities, all under the Apache 2.0 license.]]></description>

As LLM-based agents are increasingly used in long-term interactions, cumulative memory is critical for enabling personalization and maintaining stylistic consistency. However, most existing systems adopt an ``all-or-nothing'' approach to memory usage: incorporating all relevant past information can lead to Memory Anchoring, where the agent is trapped by past interactions, while excluding memory entirely results in under-utilization and the loss of important interaction history. We show that an agent's reliance on memory can be modeled as an explicit and user-controllable dimension. We first introduce a behavioral metric of memory dependence to quantify the influence of past interactions on current outputs. We then propose Steerable Memory Agent, SteeM, a framework that allows users to dynamically regulate memory reliance, ranging from a fresh-start mode that promotes innovation to a high-fidelity mode that closely follows interaction history. Experiments across different scenarios demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms conventional prompting and rigid memory masking strategies, yielding a more nuanced and effective control for personalized human-agent collaboration.]]></description>

With the rapid advancement of image generation, visual text editing using natural language instructions has received increasing attention. The main challenge of this task is to fully understand the instruction and reference image, and thus generate visual text that is style-consistent with the image. Previous methods often involve complex steps of specifying the text content and attributes, such as font size, color, and layout, without considering the stylistic consistency with the reference image. To address this, we propose UM-Text, a unified multimodal model for context understanding and visual text editing by natural language instructions. Specifically, we introduce a Visual Language Model (VLM) to process the instruction and reference image, so that the text content and layout can be elaborately designed according to the context information. To generate an accurate and harmonious visual text image, we further propose the UM-Encoder to combine the embeddings of various condition information, where the combination is automatically configured by VLM according to the input instruction. During training, we propose a regional consistency loss to offer more effective supervision for glyph generation on both latent and RGB space, and design a tailored three-stage training strategy to further enhance model performance. In addition, we contribute the UM-DATA-200K, a large-scale visual text image dataset on diverse scenes for model training. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.]]></description>

Self-consistency has emerged as a popular technique for improving large language model accuracy on reasoning tasks. The approach is straightforward: generate multiple reasoning paths and select the most common answer through majority voting. While this reliably boosts accuracy, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect genuine improvements in reasoning quality. We investigate a fundamental question that has not been studied before: does inference scaling improve reasoning faithfulness?
  We conduct a comprehensive empirical study across four frontier models (GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini-3-flash-preview, and DeepSeek-v3.2) on 100 GSM8K mathematical reasoning problems. Our analysis employs bootstrap confidence intervals, McNemar's tests for paired comparisons, and Cohen's d effect sizes to quantify the effects rigorously. The results reveal striking differences across models that challenge common assumptions about self-consistency.
  GPT-5.2 shows the expected pattern: accuracy improves from 78% to 90% at N=5, with faithfulness remaining relatively stable (0.540 to 0.510). Claude Opus 4.5 tells a completely different story. Its accuracy actually drops from 78% to 74.3% while faithfulness jumps dramatically from 0.270 to 0.891 at N=5. DeepSeek-v3.2, already at 98% accuracy, shows ceiling effects with modest faithfulness gains (0.440 to 0.541). Gemini-3-flash improves from 81% to 86% accuracy with a slight faithfulness decrease (0.260 to 0.212).
  Problem difficulty analysis reveals that GPT-5.2 solves 82% of hard problems while breaking only 13% of easy ones. Claude, in contrast, breaks 23% of easy problems, explaining its accuracy decrease. These findings matter for practitioners: self-consistency is not universally beneficial, and teams should test their specific models before deployment. We release our code and provide practical recommendations for navigating these tradeoffs.]]></description>

Evaluating Language Models (LMs) in specialized, high-stakes domains such as finance remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of open, high-quality, and domain-specific datasets. Existing general-purpose benchmarks provide broad coverage but lack the depth and domain fidelity needed to assess LMs' capabilities for real-world financial reasoning, which requires both conceptual understanding and quantitative rigor. To address this gap, we introduce FinForge, a scalable, semi-synthetic pipeline for constructing finance-specific evaluation benchmarks through a hybrid of expert-guided data curation and controlled LM-based synthesis. FinForge combines manual and programmatic corpus construction from authoritative financial sources with structured question generation and validation using Gemini 2.5 Flash. To demonstrate the pipeline's efficacy, we produce FinForge-5k, a snapshot benchmark comprising over 5,000 human-validated question-answer pairs across 11 finance subdomains, derived from a curated corpus of 100,000 verified documents totaling 143M tokens. Evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models on FinForge-5k reveals significant differences in financial reasoning, with leading models achieving accuracy levels near 80%. These findings underscore the framework's utility for diagnosing current model limitations and guiding future improvements in financial domain competence. All code and data are available at https://github.com/gtfintechlab/FinForge.]]></description>

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a principled, scalable alternative to RLHF for aligning large language models from pairwise preferences, but its internal geometric footprint remains undercharacterized, limiting audits, checkpoint comparisons, and failure prediction. We introduce SPINAL (Scaling-law and Preference Integration in Neural Alignment Layers), a diagnostic that measures how alignment reshapes representations across depth by tracing localized structural change layer by layer. Across model families, DPO produces a layerwise calibration effect concentrated in the final decoder blocks (often layers 21-30), where preference gradients most directly affect the next-token distribution. SPINAL encodes each checkpoint as a depth trace over (layer index, contraction score, transport score). The contraction score summarizes how quickly the tail of a layer's spectrum decays (how fast small modes vanish); higher values indicate stronger contraction into fewer effective directions. The transport score summarizes how much the token distribution shifts between adjacent layers using a bounded overlap measure; lower values indicate shorter, smoother steps through representation space. Aligned checkpoints show a late-layer ramp-up in contraction and a smooth reduction in transport, consistent with tightened and stabilized policy mass, while unaligned models trace higher-curvature, more entropic, and geometrically incoherent depth paths. Overall, alignment is geometrically localized: the final layers encode the dominant preference-induced corrections. SPINAL turns this localization into a practical audit signal, quantifying where alignment concentrates, how strongly it manifests, and when it begins to destabilize during training.]]></description>

Building intelligent agents capable of dexterous manipulation is essential for achieving human-like automation in both robotics and digital environments. However, existing GUI agents rely on discrete click predictions (x,y), which prohibits free-form, closed-loop trajectories (e.g. dragging a progress bar) that require continuous, on-the-fly perception and adjustment. In this work, we develop ShowUI-π, the first flow-based generative model as GUI dexterous hand, featuring the following designs: (i) Unified Discrete-Continuous Actions, integrating discrete clicks and continuous drags within a shared model, enabling flexible adaptation across diverse interaction modes; (ii) Flow-based Action Generation for drag modeling, which predicts incremental cursor adjustments from continuous visual observations via a lightweight action expert, ensuring smooth and stable trajectories; (iii) Drag Training data and Benchmark, where we manually collect and synthesize 20K drag trajectories across five domains (e.g. PowerPoint, Adobe Premiere Pro), and introduce ScreenDrag, a benchmark with comprehensive online and offline evaluation protocols for assessing GUI agents' drag capabilities. Our experiments show that proprietary GUI agents still struggle on ScreenDrag (e.g. Operator scores 13.27, and the best Gemini-2.5-CUA reaches 22.18). In contrast, ShowUI-π achieves 26.98 with only 450M parameters, underscoring both the difficulty of the task and the effectiveness of our approach. We hope this work advances GUI agents toward human-like dexterous control in digital world. The code is available at https://github.com/showlab/showui-pi.]]></description>

While AI innovation accelerates rapidly, the intellectual process behind breakthroughs -- how researchers identify gaps, synthesize prior work, and generate insights -- remains poorly understood. The lack of structured data on scientific reasoning hinders systematic analysis and development of AI research agents. We introduce Sci-Reasoning, the first dataset capturing the intellectual synthesis behind high-quality AI research. Using community-validated quality signals and an LLM-accelerated, human-verified pipeline, we trace Oral and Spotlight papers across NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR (2023-2025) to its key predecessors, articulating specific reasoning links in a structured format. Our analysis identifies 15 distinct thinking patterns, with three dominant strategies accounting for 52.7%: Gap-Driven Reframing (24.2%), Cross-Domain Synthesis (18.0%), and Representation Shift (10.5%). The most powerful innovation recipes combine multiple patterns: Gap-Driven Reframing + Representation Shift, Cross-Domain Synthesis + Representation Shift, and Gap-Driven Reframing + Cross-Domain Synthesis. This dataset enables quantitative studies of scientific progress and provides structured reasoning trajectories for training the next generation AI research agents.]]></description>

As large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, and Gemini become integrated into software development workflows, developers increasingly leave traces of AI involvement in their code comments. Among these, some comments explicitly acknowledge both the use of generative AI and the presence of technical shortcomings. Analyzing 6,540 LLM-referencing code comments from public Python and JavaScript-based GitHub repositories (November 2022-July 2025), we identified 81 that also self-admit technical debt(SATD). Developers most often describe postponed testing, incomplete adaptation, and limited understanding of AI-generated code, suggesting that AI assistance affects both when and why technical debt emerges. We term GenAI-Induced Self-admitted Technical debt (GIST) as a proposed conceptual lens to describe recurring cases where developers incorporate AI-generated code while explicitly expressing uncertainty about its behavior or correctness.]]></description>

Transformer-based language models often achieve strong results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks while remaining fragile on basic numerical understanding and arithmetic operations. A central limitation is that numbers are processed as symbolic tokens whose embeddings do not explicitly encode numerical value, leading to systematic errors. We introduce a value-aware numerical representation that augments standard tokenized inputs with a dedicated prefix token whose embedding is explicitly conditioned on the underlying numerical value. This mechanism injects magnitude information directly into the model's input space while remaining compatible with existing tokenizers and decoder-only Transformer architectures. Evaluation on arithmetic tasks shows that the proposed approach outperforms baselines across numerical formats, tasks, and operand lengths. These results indicate that explicitly encoding numerical value is an effective and efficient way to improve fundamental numerical robustness in language models.]]></description>

Code generation tasks aim to automate the conversion of user requirements into executable code, significantly reducing manual development efforts and enhancing software productivity. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced code generation, though their efficiency is still impacted by certain inherent architectural constraints. Each token generation necessitates a complete inference pass, requiring persistent retention of contextual information in memory and escalating resource consumption. While existing research prioritizes inference-phase optimizations such as prompt compression and model quantization, the generation phase remains underexplored. To tackle these challenges, we propose a knowledge-infused framework named ShortCoder, which optimizes code generation efficiency while preserving semantic equivalence and readability. In particular, we introduce: (1) ten syntax-level simplification rules for Python, derived from AST-preserving transformations, achieving 18.1% token reduction without functional compromise; (2) a hybrid data synthesis pipeline integrating rule-based rewriting with LLM-guided refinement, producing ShorterCodeBench, a corpus of validated tuples of original code and simplified code with semantic consistency; (3) a fine-tuning strategy that injects conciseness awareness into the base LLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ShortCoder consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on HumanEval, achieving an improvement of 18.1%-37.8% in generation efficiency over previous methods while ensuring the performance of code generation.]]></description>

Segment Anything 3 (SAM3) has established a powerful foundation that robustly detects, segments, and tracks specified targets in videos. However, in its original implementation, its group-level collective memory selection is suboptimal for complex multi-object scenarios, as it employs a synchronized decision across all concurrent targets conditioned on their average performance, often overlooking individual reliability. To this end, we propose SAM3-DMS, a training-free decoupled strategy that utilizes fine-grained memory selection on individual objects. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves robust identity preservation and tracking stability. Notably, our advantage becomes more pronounced with increased target density, establishing a solid foundation for simultaneous multi-target video segmentation in the wild.]]></description>

3D pose estimation from sparse multi-views is a critical task for numerous applications, including action recognition, sports analysis, and human-robot interaction. Optimization-based methods typically follow a two-stage pipeline, first detecting 2D keypoints in each view and then associating these detections across views to triangulate the 3D pose. Existing methods rely on mere pairwise associations to model this correspondence problem, treating global consistency between views (i.e., cycle consistency) as a soft constraint. Yet, reconciling these constraints for multiple views becomes brittle when spurious associations propagate errors. We thus propose COMPOSE, a novel framework that formulates multi-view pose correspondence matching as a hypergraph partitioning problem rather than through pairwise association. While the complexity of the resulting integer linear program grows exponentially in theory, we introduce an efficient geometric pruning strategy to substantially reduce the search space. COMPOSE achieves improvements of up to 23% in average precision over previous optimization-based methods and up to 11% over self-supervised end-to-end learned methods, offering a promising solution to a widely studied problem.]]></description>

Modern video generative models based on diffusion models can produce very realistic clips, but they are computationally inefficient, often requiring minutes of GPU time for just a few seconds of video. This inefficiency poses a critical barrier to deploying generative video in applications that require real-time interactions, such as embodied AI and VR/AR. This paper explores a new strategy for camera-conditioned video generation of static scenes: using diffusion-based generative models to generate a sparse set of keyframes, and then synthesizing the full video through 3D reconstruction and rendering. By lifting keyframes into a 3D representation and rendering intermediate views, our approach amortizes the generation cost across hundreds of frames while enforcing geometric consistency. We further introduce a model that predicts the optimal number of keyframes for a given camera trajectory, allowing the system to adaptively allocate computation. Our final method, SRENDER, uses very sparse keyframes for simple trajectories and denser ones for complex camera motion. This results in video generation that is more than 40 times faster than the diffusion-based baseline in generating 20 seconds of video, while maintaining high visual fidelity and temporal stability, offering a practical path toward efficient and controllable video synthesis.]]></description>

LLMs are increasingly being integrated into clinical workflows, yet they often lack clinical empathy, an essential aspect of effective doctor-patient communication. Existing NLP frameworks focus on reactively labeling empathy in doctors' responses but offer limited support for anticipatory modeling of empathy needs, especially in general health queries. We introduce the Empathy Applicability Framework (EAF), a theory-driven approach that classifies patient queries in terms of the applicability of emotional reactions and interpretations, based on clinical, contextual, and linguistic cues. We release a benchmark of real patient queries, dual-annotated by Humans and GPT-4o. In the subset with human consensus, we also observe substantial human-GPT alignment. To validate EAF, we train classifiers on human-labeled and GPT-only annotations to predict empathy applicability, achieving strong performance and outperforming the heuristic and zero-shot LLM baselines. Error analysis highlights persistent challenges: implicit distress, clinical-severity ambiguity, and contextual hardship, underscoring the need for multi-annotator modeling, clinician-in-the-loop calibration, and culturally diverse annotation. EAF provides a framework for identifying empathy needs before response generation, establishes a benchmark for anticipatory empathy modeling, and enables supporting empathetic communication in asynchronous healthcare.]]></description>

As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to scale, post-training pruning has emerged as a promising approach to reduce computational costs while preserving performance. Existing methods such as SparseGPT and Wanda achieve high sparsity through layer-wise weight reconstruction or activation-aware magnitude pruning, but rely on uniform or hand-crafted heuristics to determine per-layer sparsity ratios. Moreover, recent work has shown that pruned LLMs suffer from severe factual knowledge degradation, with structured pruning methods experiencing near-total collapse in factual question-answering capabilities. We introduce agent-guided pruning, where a foundation model acts as an adaptive pruning agent to intelligently select which layers to prune at each iteration while preserving critical knowledge pathways. Our method constructs layer-wise sensitivity profiles by combining Wanda-inspired weight-activation metrics with gradient importance scores, normalized as z-scores for model-agnostic comparison. These statistics are processed by an LLM agent equipped with self-reflection capabilities, enabling it to learn from previous pruning outcomes and iteratively refine its strategy. A checkpoint rollback mechanism maintains model quality by reverting when perplexity degradation exceeds a threshold. We evaluate our approach on Qwen3 models (4B and 8B parameters) at approximately 45% sparsity, demonstrating substantial improvements over structured pruning baselines: 56% relative improvement in MMLU accuracy, 19x better factual knowledge retention on FreebaseQA, and 69% lower perplexity degradation. Notably, our framework requires no retraining, operates in a model-agnostic manner, and exhibits effective self-correction with only 2-4 rollbacks across 21-40 iterations, demonstrating that foundation models can effectively guide the compression of other foundation models.]]></description>

Structure-based and ligand-based computational drug design have traditionally relied on disjoint data sources and modeling assumptions, limiting their joint use at scale. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Geometric Learning for Unified Computational Drug Design (ConGLUDe), a single contrastive geometric model that unifies structure- and ligand-based training. ConGLUDe couples a geometric protein encoder that produces whole-protein representations and implicit embeddings of predicted binding sites with a fast ligand encoder, removing the need for pre-defined pockets. By aligning ligands with both global protein representations and multiple candidate binding sites through contrastive learning, ConGLUDe supports ligand-conditioned pocket prediction in addition to virtual screening and target fishing, while being trained jointly on protein-ligand complexes and large-scale bioactivity data. Across diverse benchmarks, ConGLUDe achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot virtual screening performance in settings where no binding pocket information is provided as input, substantially outperforms existing methods on a challenging target fishing task, and demonstrates competitive ligand-conditioned pocket selection. These results highlight the advantages of unified structure-ligand training and position ConGLUDe as a step toward general-purpose foundation models for drug discovery.]]></description>

Large Language Model (LLM) routers dynamically select optimal models for given inputs. Existing approaches typically assume access to ground-truth labeled data, which is often unavailable in practice, especially when user request distributions are heterogeneous and unknown. We introduce Routing with Generated Data (RGD), a challenging setting in which routers are trained exclusively on generated queries and answers produced from high-level task descriptions by generator LLMs. We evaluate query-answer routers (using both queries and labels) and query-only routers across four diverse benchmarks and 12 models, finding that query-answer routers degrade faster than query-only routers as generator quality decreases. Our analysis reveals two crucial characteristics of effective generators: they must accurately respond to their own questions, and their questions must produce sufficient performance differentiation among the model pool. We then show how filtering for these characteristics can improve the quality of generated data. We further propose CASCAL, a novel query-only router that estimates model correctness through consensus voting and identifies model-specific skill niches via hierarchical clustering. CASCAL is substantially more robust to generator quality, outperforming the best query-answer router by 4.6% absolute accuracy when trained on weak generator data.]]></description>

Deep research systems are widely used for multi-step web research, analysis, and cross-source synthesis, yet their evaluation remains challenging. Existing benchmarks often require annotation-intensive task construction, rely on static evaluation dimensions, or fail to reliably verify facts when citations are missing. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DeepResearchEval, an automated framework for deep research task construction and agentic evaluation. For task construction, we propose a persona-driven pipeline generating realistic, complex research tasks anchored in diverse user profiles, applying a two-stage filter Task Qualification and Search Necessity to retain only tasks requiring multi-source evidence integration and external retrieval. For evaluation, we propose an agentic pipeline with two components: an Adaptive Point-wise Quality Evaluation that dynamically derives task-specific evaluation dimensions, criteria, and weights conditioned on each generated task, and an Active Fact-Checking that autonomously extracts and verifies report statements via web search, even when citations are missing.]]></description>

The graphical Lasso (GLASSO) is a widely used algorithm for learning high-dimensional undirected Gaussian graphical models (GGM). Given i.i.d. observations from a multivariate normal distribution, GLASSO estimates the precision matrix by maximizing the log-likelihood with an \ell_1-penalty on the off-diagonal entries. However, selecting an optimal regularization parameter λin this unsupervised setting remains a significant challenge. A well-known issue is that existing methods, such as out-of-sample likelihood maximization, select a single global λand do not account for heterogeneity in variable scaling or partial variances. Standardizing the data to unit variances, although a common workaround, has been shown to negatively affect graph recovery. Addressing the problem of nodewise adaptive tuning in graph estimation is crucial for applications like computational neuroscience, where brain networks are constructed from highly heterogeneous, region-specific fMRI data.
  In this work, we develop Locally Adaptive Regularization for Graph Estimation (LARGE), an approach to adaptively learn nodewise tuning parameters to improve graph estimation and selection. In each block coordinate descent step of GLASSO, we augment the nodewise Lasso regression to jointly estimate the regression coefficients and error variance, which in turn guides the adaptive learning of nodewise penalties. In simulations, LARGE consistently outperforms benchmark methods in graph recovery, demonstrates greater stability across replications, and achieves the best estimation accuracy in the most difficult simulation settings. We demonstrate the practical utility of our method by estimating brain functional connectivity from a real fMRI data set.]]></description>

Multi-Task Learning (MTL) combined with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a promising direction for parameter-efficient deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). By sharing a single adapter across multiple tasks, one can significantly reduce storage overhead. However, this approach suffers from negative transfer, where conflicting gradient updates from distinct tasks degrade the performance of individual tasks compared to single-task fine-tuning. This problem is exacerbated in LoRA due to the low-rank constraint, which limits the optimization landscape's capacity to accommodate diverse task requirements. In this paper, we propose Ortho-LoRA, a gradient projection method specifically tailored for the bipartite structure of LoRA. Ortho-LoRA dynamically projects conflicting task gradients onto the orthogonal complement of each other within the intrinsic LoRA subspace. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark demonstrate that Ortho-LoRA effectively mitigates task interference, outperforming standard joint training and recovering 95\% of the performance gap between multi-task and single-task baselines with negligible computational overhead.]]></description>

Modern supply chains are increasingly exposed to disruptions from geopolitical events, demand shocks, trade restrictions, to natural disasters. While many of these disruptions originate deep in the supply network, most companies still lack visibility beyond Tier-1 suppliers, leaving upstream vulnerabilities undetected until the impact cascades downstream. To overcome this blind-spot and move from reactive recovery to proactive resilience, we introduce a minimally supervised agentic AI framework that autonomously monitors, analyses, and responds to disruptions across extended supply networks. The architecture comprises seven specialised agents powered by large language models and deterministic tools that jointly detect disruption signals from unstructured news, map them to multi-tier supplier networks, evaluate exposure based on network structure, and recommend mitigations such as alternative sourcing options. \rev{We evaluate the framework across 30 synthesised scenarios covering three automotive manufacturers and five disruption classes. The system achieves high accuracy across core tasks, with F1 scores between 0.962 and 0.991, and performs full end-to-end analyses in a mean of 3.83 minutes at a cost of \$0.0836 per disruption. Relative to industry benchmarks of multi-day, analyst-driven assessments, this represents a reduction of more than three orders of magnitude in response time. A real-world case study of the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict further demonstrates operational applicability. This work establishes a foundational step toward building resilient, proactive, and autonomous supply chains capable of managing disruptions across deep-tier networks.]]></description>

We present STEP3-VL-10B, a lightweight open-source foundation model designed to redefine the trade-off between compact efficiency and frontier-level multimodal intelligence. STEP3-VL-10B is realized through two strategic shifts: first, a unified, fully unfrozen pre-training strategy on 1.2T multimodal tokens that integrates a language-aligned Perception Encoder with a Qwen3-8B decoder to establish intrinsic vision-language synergy; and second, a scaled post-training pipeline featuring over 1k iterations of reinforcement learning. Crucially, we implement Parallel Coordinated Reasoning (PaCoRe) to scale test-time compute, allocating resources to scalable perceptual reasoning that explores and synthesizes diverse visual hypotheses. Consequently, despite its compact 10B footprint, STEP3-VL-10B rivals or surpasses models 10$\times$-20$\times$ larger (e.g., GLM-4.6V-106B, Qwen3-VL-235B) and top-tier proprietary flagships like Gemini 2.5 Pro and Seed-1.5-VL. Delivering best-in-class performance, it records 92.2% on MMBench and 80.11% on MMMU, while excelling in complex reasoning with 94.43% on AIME2025 and 75.95% on MathVision. We release the full model suite to provide the community with a powerful, efficient, and reproducible baseline.]]></description>

Multi-agent systems have evolved into practical LLM-driven collaborators for many applications, gaining robustness from diversity and cross-checking. However, multi-agent RL (MARL) training is resource-intensive and unstable: co-adapting teammates induce non-stationarity, and rewards are often sparse and high-variance. Therefore, we introduce \textbf{Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (MATTRL)}, a framework that injects structured textual experience into multi-agent deliberation at inference time. MATTRL forms a multi-expert team of specialists for multi-turn discussions, retrieves and integrates test-time experiences, and reaches consensus for final decision-making. We also study credit assignment for constructing a turn-level experience pool, then reinjecting it into the dialogue. Across challenging benchmarks in medicine, math, and education, MATTRL improves accuracy by an average of 3.67\% over a multi-agent baseline, and by 8.67\% over comparable single-agent baselines. Ablation studies examine different credit-assignment schemes and provide a detailed comparison of how they affect training outcomes. MATTRL offers a stable, effective and efficient path to distribution-shift-robust multi-agent reasoning without tuning.]]></description>

Monocular visual SLAM enables 3D reconstruction from internet video and autonomous navigation on resource-constrained platforms, yet suffers from scale drift, i.e., the gradual divergence of estimated scale over long sequences. Existing frame-to-frame methods achieve real-time performance through local optimization but accumulate scale drift due to the lack of global constraints among independent windows. To address this, we propose SCE-SLAM, an end-to-end SLAM system that maintains scale consistency through scene coordinate embeddings, which are learned patch-level representations encoding 3D geometric relationships under a canonical scale reference. The framework consists of two key modules: geometry-guided aggregation that leverages 3D spatial proximity to propagate scale information from historical observations through geometry-modulated attention, and scene coordinate bundle adjustment that anchors current estimates to the reference scale through explicit 3D coordinate constraints decoded from the scene coordinate embeddings. Experiments on KITTI, Waymo, and vKITTI demonstrate substantial improvements: our method reduces absolute trajectory error by 8.36m on KITTI compared to the best prior approach, while maintaining 36 FPS and achieving scale consistency across large-scale scenes.]]></description>

Identifying individual animals in long-duration videos is essential for behavioral ecology, wildlife monitoring, and livestock management. Traditional methods require extensive manual annotation, while existing self-supervised approaches are computationally demanding and ill-suited for long sequences due to memory constraints and temporal error propagation. We introduce a highly efficient, self-supervised method that reframes animal identification as a global clustering task rather than a sequential tracking problem. Our approach assumes a known, fixed number of individuals within a single video -- a common scenario in practice -- and requires only bounding box detections and the total count. By sampling pairs of frames, using a frozen pre-trained backbone, and employing a self-bootstrapping mechanism with the Hungarian algorithm for in-batch pseudo-label assignment, our method learns discriminative features without identity labels. We adapt a Binary Cross Entropy loss from vision-language models, enabling state-of-the-art accuracy ($>$97\%) while consuming less than 1 GB of GPU memory per batch -- an order of magnitude less than standard contrastive methods. Evaluated on challenging real-world datasets (3D-POP pigeons and 8-calves feeding videos), our framework matches or surpasses supervised baselines trained on over 1,000 labeled frames, effectively removing the manual annotation bottleneck. This work enables practical, high-accuracy animal identification on consumer-grade hardware, with broad applicability in resource-constrained research settings.

Large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition but struggle with classes that are rarely seen during pretraining, including newly emerging entities and culturally specific categories. We introduce LiteEmbed, a lightweight framework for few-shot personalization of CLIP that enables new classes to be added without retraining its encoders. LiteEmbed performs subspace-guided optimization of text embeddings within CLIP's vocabulary, leveraging a PCA-based decomposition that disentangles coarse semantic directions from fine-grained variations. Two complementary objectives, coarse alignment and fine separation, jointly preserve global semantic consistency while enhancing discriminability among visually similar classes. Once optimized, the embeddings are plug-and-play, seamlessly substituting CLIP's original text features across classification, retrieval, segmentation, and detection tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial gains over prior methods, establishing LiteEmbed as an effective approach for adapting CLIP to underrepresented, rare, or unseen classes.]]></description>

Estimating physically accurate, simulation-ready garments from a single image is challenging due to the absence of image-to-physics datasets and the ill-posed nature of this problem. Prior methods either require multi-view capture and expensive differentiable simulation or predict only garment geometry without the material properties required for realistic simulation. We propose a feed-forward framework that sidesteps these limitations by first fine-tuning a vision-language model to infer material composition and fabric attributes from real images, and then training a lightweight predictor that maps these attributes to the corresponding physical fabric parameters using a small dataset of material-physics measurements. Our approach introduces two new datasets (FTAG and T2P) and delivers simulation-ready garments from a single image without iterative optimization. Experiments show that our estimator achieves superior accuracy in material composition estimation and fabric attribute prediction, and by passing them through our physics parameter estimator, we further achieve higher-fidelity simulations compared to state-of-the-art image-to-garment methods.]]></description>

Tabular Foundation Models (TFMs) have recently shown strong in-context learning capabilities on structured data, achieving zero-shot performance comparable to traditional machine learning methods. We find that zero-shot TFMs already achieve strong performance, while the benefits of fine-tuning are highly model and data-dependent. Meta-learning and PEFT provide moderate gains under specific conditions, whereas full supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often reduces accuracy or calibration quality. This work presents the first comprehensive study of fine-tuning in TFMs across benchmarks including TALENT, OpenML-CC18, and TabZilla. We compare Zero-Shot, Meta-Learning, Supervised (SFT), and parameter-efficient (PEFT) approaches, analyzing how dataset factors such as imbalance, size, and dimensionality affect outcomes. Our findings cover performance, calibration, and fairness, offering practical guidelines on when fine-tuning is most beneficial and its limitations.]]></description>

Underwater video analysis is particularly challenging due to factors such as low lighting, color distortion, and turbidity, which compromise visual data quality and directly impact the performance of perception modules in robotic applications. This work proposes AquaFeat+, a plug-and-play pipeline designed to enhance features specifically for automated vision tasks, rather than for human perceptual quality. The architecture includes modules for color correction, hierarchical feature enhancement, and an adaptive residual output, which are trained end-to-end and guided directly by the loss function of the final application. Trained and evaluated in the FishTrack23 dataset, AquaFeat+ achieves significant improvements in object detection, classification, and tracking metrics, validating its effectiveness for enhancing perception tasks in underwater robotic applications.]]></description>

Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) has been widely evaluated using the semantic frameworks of WordNet, BabelNet, and the Oxford Dictionary of English. However, for the UCREL Semantic Analysis System (USAS) framework, no open extensive evaluation has been performed beyond lexical coverage or single language evaluation. In this work, we perform the largest semantic tagging evaluation of the rule based system that uses the lexical resources in the USAS framework covering five different languages using four existing datasets and one novel Chinese dataset. We create a new silver labelled English dataset, to overcome the lack of manually tagged training data, that we train and evaluate various mono and multilingual neural models in both mono and cross-lingual evaluation setups with comparisons to their rule based counterparts, and show how a rule based system can be enhanced with a neural network model. The resulting neural network models, including the data they were trained on, the Chinese evaluation dataset, and all of the code have been released as open resources.]]></description>

Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly popular, producing a large share of AI-generated images online. To compare model quality, voting-based leaderboards have become the standard, relying on anonymized model outputs for fairness. In this work, we show that such anonymity can be easily broken. We find that generations from each T2I model form distinctive clusters in the image embedding space, enabling accurate deanonymization without prompt control or training data. Using 22 models and 280 prompts (150K images), our centroid-based method achieves high accuracy and reveals systematic model-specific signatures. We further introduce a prompt-level distinguishability metric and conduct large-scale analyses showing how certain prompts can lead to near-perfect distinguishability. Our findings expose fundamental security flaws in T2I leaderboards and motivate stronger anonymization defenses.]]></description>

While GUI agents have shown strong performance under explicit and completion instructions, real-world deployment requires aligning with users' more complex implicit intents. In this work, we highlight Hierarchical Implicit Intent Alignment for Personalized GUI Agent (PersonalAlign), a new agent task that requires agents to leverage long-term user records as persistent context to resolve omitted preferences in vague instructions and anticipate latent routines by user state for proactive assistance. To facilitate this study, we introduce AndroidIntent, a benchmark designed to evaluate agents' ability in resolving vague instructions and providing proactive suggestions through reasoning over long-term user records. We annotated 775 user-specific preferences and 215 routines from 20k long-term records across different users for evaluation. Furthermore, we introduce Hierarchical Intent Memory Agent (HIM-Agent), which maintains a continuously updating personal memory and hierarchically organizes user preferences and routines for personalization. Finally, we evaluate a range of GUI agents on AndroidIntent, including GPT-5, Qwen3-VL, and UI-TARS, further results show that HIM-Agent significantly improves both execution and proactive performance by 15.7% and 7.3%.]]></description>

Large-scale optimization is a key backbone of modern business decision-making. However, building these models is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. We address this by proposing LEAN-LLM-OPT, a LightwEight AgeNtic workflow construction framework for LLM-assisted large-scale OPTimization auto-formulation. LEAN-LLM-OPT takes as input a problem description together with associated datasets and orchestrates a team of LLM agents to produce an optimization formulation. Specifically, upon receiving a query, two upstream LLM agents dynamically construct a workflow that specifies, step-by-step, how optimization models for similar problems can be formulated. A downstream LLM agent then follows this workflow to generate the final output. Leveraging LLMs' text-processing capabilities and common modeling practices, the workflow decomposes the modeling task into a sequence of structured sub-tasks and offloads mechanical data-handling operations to auxiliary tools. This design alleviates the downstream agent's burden related to planning and data handling, allowing it to focus on the most challenging components that cannot be readily standardized. Extensive simulations show that LEAN-LLM-OPT, instantiated with GPT-4.1 and the open source gpt-oss-20B, achieves strong performance on large-scale optimization modeling tasks and is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, in a Singapore Airlines choice-based revenue management use case, LEAN-LLM-OPT demonstrates practical value by achieving leading performance across a range of scenarios. Along the way, we introduce Large-Scale-OR and Air-NRM, the first comprehensive benchmarks for large-scale optimization auto-formulation. The code and data of this work is available at https://github.com/CoraLiang01/lean-llm-opt.]]></description>

Taxonomies form the backbone of structured knowledge representation across diverse domains, enabling applications such as e-commerce catalogs, semantic search, and biomedical discovery. Yet, manual taxonomy expansion is labor-intensive and cannot keep pace with the emergence of new concepts. Existing automated methods rely on point-based vector embeddings, which model symmetric similarity and thus struggle with the asymmetric "is-a" relationships that are fundamental to taxonomies. Box embeddings offer a promising alternative by enabling containment and disjointness, but they face key issues: (i) unstable gradients at the intersection boundaries, (ii) no notion of semantic uncertainty, and (iii) limited capacity to represent polysemy or ambiguity. We address these shortcomings with TaxoBell, a Gaussian box embedding framework that translates between box geometries and multivariate Gaussian distributions, where means encode semantic location and covariances encode uncertainty. Energy-based optimization yields stable optimization, robust modeling of ambiguous concepts, and interpretable hierarchical reasoning. Extensive experimentation on five benchmark datasets demonstrates that TaxoBell significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art taxonomy expansion baselines by 19% in MRR and around 25% in Recall@k. We further demonstrate the advantages and pitfalls of TaxoBell with error analysis and ablation studies.]]></description>

Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities across NLP tasks, struggle with phonologically-grounded phenomena like rhyme detection and generation. This is even more evident in lower-resource languages such as Modern Greek. In this paper, we present a hybrid system that combines LLMs with deterministic phonological algorithms to achieve accurate rhyme identification/analysis and generation. Our approach implements a comprehensive taxonomy of Greek rhyme types, including Pure, Rich, Imperfect, Mosaic, and Identical Pre-rhyme Vowel (IDV) patterns, and employs an agentic generation pipeline with phonological verification. We evaluate multiple prompting strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, Chain-of-Thought, and RAG-augmented) across several LLMs including Claude 3.7 and 4.5, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 and open-weight models like Llama 3.1 8B and 70B and Mistral Large. Results reveal a significant "Reasoning Gap": while native-like models (Claude 3.7) perform intuitively (40\% accuracy in identification), reasoning-heavy models (Claude 4.5) achieve state-of-the-art performance (54\%) only when prompted with Chain-of-Thought. Most critically, pure LLM generation fails catastrophically (under 4\% valid poems), while our hybrid verification loop restores performance to 73.1\%. We release our system and a crucial, rigorously cleaned corpus of 40,000+ rhymes, derived from the Anemoskala and Interwar Poetry corpora, to support future research.]]></description>

Efficiently optimizing battery charging protocols is challenging because each evaluation is slow, costly, and non-differentiable. Many existing approaches address this difficulty by heavily constraining the protocol search space, which limits the diversity of protocols that can be explored, preventing the discovery of higher-performing solutions. We introduce two gradient-free, LLM-driven closed-loop methods: Prompt-to-Optimizer (P2O), which uses an LLM to propose the code for small neural-network-based protocols, which are then trained by an inner loop, and Prompt-to-Protocol (P2P), which simply writes an explicit function for the current and its scalar parameters. Across our case studies, LLM-guided P2O outperforms neural networks designed by Bayesian optimization, evolutionary algorithms, and random search. In a realistic fast charging scenario, both P2O and P2P yield around a 4.2 percent improvement in state of health (capacity retention based health metric under fast charging cycling) over a state-of-the-art multi-step constant current (CC) baseline, with P2P achieving this under matched evaluation budgets (same number of protocol evaluations). These results demonstrate that LLMs can expand the space of protocol functional forms, incorporate language-based constraints, and enable efficient optimization in high cost experimental settings.]]></description>

The rapid adoption of large language model (LLM)-based systems -- from chatbots to autonomous agents capable of executing code and financial transactions -- has created a new attack surface that existing security frameworks inadequately address. The dominant framing of these threats as "prompt injection" -- a catch-all phrase for security failures in LLM-based systems -- obscures a more complex reality: Attacks on LLM-based systems increasingly involve multi-step sequences that mirror traditional malware campaigns. In this paper, we propose that attacks targeting LLM-based applications constitute a distinct class of malware, which we term \textit{promptware}, and introduce a five-step kill chain model for analyzing these threats. The framework comprises Initial Access (prompt injection), Privilege Escalation (jailbreaking), Persistence (memory and retrieval poisoning), Lateral Movement (cross-system and cross-user propagation), and Actions on Objective (ranging from data exfiltration to unauthorized transactions). By mapping recent attacks to this structure, we demonstrate that LLM-related attacks follow systematic sequences analogous to traditional malware campaigns. The promptware kill chain offers security practitioners a structured methodology for threat modeling and provides a common vocabulary for researchers across AI safety and cybersecurity to address a rapidly evolving threat landscape.]]></description>

Machine unlearning is becoming essential for building trustworthy and compliant language models. Yet unlearning success varies considerably across individual samples: some are reliably erased, while others persist despite the same procedure. We argue that this disparity is not only a data-side phenomenon, but also reflects model-internal mechanisms that encode and protect memorized information. We study this problem from a mechanistic perspective based on model circuits--structured interaction pathways that govern how predictions are formed. We propose Circuit-guided Unlearning Difficulty (CUD), a {\em pre-unlearning} metric that assigns each sample a continuous difficulty score using circuit-level signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CUD reliably separates intrinsically easy and hard samples, and remains stable across unlearning methods. We identify key circuit-level patterns that reveal a mechanistic signature of difficulty: easy-to-unlearn samples are associated with shorter, shallower interactions concentrated in earlier-to-intermediate parts of the original model, whereas hard samples rely on longer and deeper pathways closer to late-stage computation. Compared to existing qualitative studies, CUD takes a first step toward a principled, fine-grained, and interpretable analysis of unlearning difficulty; and motivates the development of unlearning methods grounded in model mechanisms.]]></description>

As artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into news production, calls for transparency about the use of AI have gained considerable traction. Recent studies suggest that AI disclosures can lead to a ``transparency dilemma'', where disclosure reduces readers' trust. However, little is known about how the \textit{level of detail} in AI disclosures influences trust and contributes to this dilemma within the news context. In this 3$\times$2$\times$2 mixed factorial study with 40 participants, we investigate how three levels of AI disclosures (none, one-line, detailed) across two types of news (politics and lifestyle) and two levels of AI involvement (low and high) affect news readers' trust. We measured trust using the News Media Trust questionnaire, along with two decision behaviors: source-checking and subscription decisions. Questionnaire responses and subscription rates showed a decline in trust only for detailed AI disclosures, whereas source-checking behavior increased for both one-line and detailed disclosures, with the effect being more pronounced for detailed disclosures. Insights from semi-structured interviews suggest that source-checking behavior was primarily driven by interest in the topic, followed by trust, whereas trust was the main factor influencing subscription decisions. Around two-thirds of participants expressed a preference for detailed disclosures, while most participants who preferred one-line indicated a need for detail-on-demand disclosure formats. Our findings show that not all AI disclosures lead to a transparency dilemma, but instead reflect a trade-off between readers' desire for more transparency and their trust in AI-assisted news content.]]></description>

Accurate and early perception of potential intrusion targets is essential for ensuring the safety of railway transportation systems. However, most existing systems focus narrowly on object classification within fixed visual scopes and apply rule-based heuristics to determine intrusion status, often overlooking targets that pose latent intrusion risks. Anticipating such risks requires the cognition of spatial context and temporal dynamics for the object of interest (OOI), which presents challenges for conventional visual models. To facilitate deep intrusion perception, we introduce a novel benchmark, CogRail, which integrates curated open-source datasets with cognitively driven question-answer annotations to support spatio-temporal reasoning and prediction. Building upon this benchmark, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art visual-language models (VLMs) using multimodal prompts to identify their strengths and limitations in this domain. Furthermore, we fine-tune VLMs for better performance and propose a joint fine-tuning framework that integrates three core tasks, position perception, movement prediction, and threat analysis, facilitating effective adaptation of general-purpose foundation models into specialized models tailored for cognitive intrusion perception. Extensive experiments reveal that current large-scale multimodal models struggle with the complex spatial-temporal reasoning required by the cognitive intrusion perception task, underscoring the limitations of existing foundation models in this safety-critical domain. In contrast, our proposed joint fine-tuning framework significantly enhances model performance by enabling targeted adaptation to domain-specific reasoning demands, highlighting the advantages of structured multi-task learning in improving both accuracy and interpretability. Code will be available at https://github.com/Hub-Tian/CogRail.]]></description>

Reinforcement learning (RL)-based enhancement of large language models (LLMs) often leads to reduced output diversity, undermining their utility in open-ended tasks like creative writing. Current methods lack explicit mechanisms for guiding diverse exploration and instead prioritize optimization efficiency and performance over diversity. This paper proposes an RL framework structured around a semi-structured long Chain-of-Thought (CoT), in which the generation process is decomposed into explicitly planned intermediate steps. We introduce a Diverse Planning Branching method that strategically introduces divergence at the planning phase based on diversity variation, alongside a group-aware diversity reward to encourage distinct trajectories. Experimental results on creative writing benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves output diversity without compromising generation quality, consistently outperforming existing baselines.]]></description>

Most Multimodal Sentiment Analysis research has focused on point-wise regression. While straightforward, this approach is sensitive to label noise and neglects whether one sample is more positive than another, resulting in unstable predictions and poor correlation alignment. Pairwise ordinal learning frameworks emerged to address this gap, capturing relative order by learning from comparisons. Yet, they introduce two new trade-offs: First, they assign uniform importance to all comparisons, failing to adaptively focus on hard-to-rank samples. Second, they employ static ranking margins, which fail to reflect the varying semantic distances between sentiment groups. To address this, we propose a Two-Stage Group-wise Ranking and Calibration Framework (GRCF) that adapts the philosophy of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our framework resolves these trade-offs by simultaneously preserving relative ordinal structure, ensuring absolute score calibration, and adaptively focusing on difficult samples. Specifically, Stage 1 introduces a GRPO-inspired Advantage-Weighted Dynamic Margin Ranking Loss to build a fine-grained ordinal structure. Stage 2 then employs an MAE-driven objective to align prediction magnitudes. To validate its generalizability, we extend GRCF to classification tasks, including multimodal humor detection and sarcasm detection. GRCF achieves state-of-the-art performance on core regression benchmarks, while also showing strong generalizability in classification tasks.]]></description>

Vision-based policies for robot manipulation have achieved significant recent success, but are still brittle to distribution shifts such as camera viewpoint variations. Robot demonstration data is scarce and often lacks appropriate variation in camera viewpoints. Simulation offers a way to collect robot demonstrations at scale with comprehensive coverage of different viewpoints, but presents a visual sim2real challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose MANGO -- an unpaired image translation method with a novel segmentation-conditioned InfoNCE loss, a highly-regularized discriminator design, and a modified PatchNCE loss. We find that these elements are crucial for maintaining viewpoint consistency during sim2real translation. When training MANGO, we only require a small amount of fixed-camera data from the real world, but show that our method can generate diverse unseen viewpoints by translating simulated observations. In this domain, MANGO outperforms all other image translation methods we tested. Imitation-learning policies trained on data augmented by MANGO are able to achieve success rates as high as 60\% on views that the non-augmented policy fails completely on.]]></description>

In recent years, foundation models have become very popular due to their exceptional performance, mainly in natural language (NLP) tasks where they were first introduced. These models usually consist of hundreds of millions, or even billions, of parameters, making them resource-intensive during training and in production systems, leading to increased costs. This paper focuses on the reduction of a foundation's model size when applied to music information retrieval (MIR) tasks. Our research combines the Branchformer architecture with SummaryMixing, which were first applied in speech recognition, along with a random quantization process. To facilitate reproducibility, we conduct pre-training on publicly available datasets, complemented by a proprietary dataset comparable in scale to other private datasets reported in the literature. We ensure robust evaluation by using a framework consisting of a variety of downstream MIR tasks. Our results show that our architecture achieves competitive performance when compared with other state-of-the-art models that use multi-head self-attention, while reducing the model size from 8.5% up to 12.3%.]]></description>

Point cloud registration is a central theme in computer vision, with alignment algorithms continuously improving for greater robustness. Commonly used methods evaluate Euclidean distances between point clouds and minimize an objective function, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). However, these approaches are most effective when the point clouds are well-prealigned and issues such as differences in density, noise, holes, and limited overlap can compromise the results. Traditional methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP), require choosing one point cloud as fixed, since Euclidean distances lack commutativity. When only one point cloud has issues, adjustments can be made, but in real scenarios, both point clouds may be affected, often necessitating preprocessing. The authors introduce a novel differential entropy-based metric, designed to serve as the objective function within an optimization framework for fine rigid pairwise 3D point cloud registration, denoted as Iterative Differential Entropy Minimization (IDEM). This metric does not depend on the choice of a fixed point cloud and, during transformations, reveals a clear minimum corresponding to the best alignment. Multiple case studies are conducted, and the results are compared with those obtained using RMSE, Chamfer distance, and Hausdorff distance. The proposed metric proves effective even with density differences, noise, holes, and partial overlap, where RMSE does not always yield optimal alignment.]]></description>

Online information access (IA) platforms are targets of authoritarian capture. These concerns are particularly serious and urgent today in light of the rising levels of democratic erosion worldwide, the emerging capabilities of generative AI technologies such as AI persuasion, and the increasing concentration of economic and political power in the hands of Big Tech. This raises the question of what alternative IA infrastructure we must reimagine and build to mitigate the risks of authoritarian capture of our information ecosystems. We explore this question through the lens of Paulo Freire's theories of emancipatory pedagogy. Freire's theories provide a radically different lens for exploring IA's sociotechnical concerns relative to the current dominating frames of fairness, accountability, confidentiality, transparency, and safety. We make explicit, with the intention to challenge, the dichotomy of how we relate to technology as either technologists (who envision and build technology) and its users. We posit that this mirrors the teacher-student relationship in Freire's analysis. By extending Freire's analysis to IA, we challenge the notion that it is the burden of the (altruistic) technologists to come up with interventions to mitigate the risks that emerging technologies pose to marginalized communities. Instead, we advocate that the first task for the technologists is to pose these as problems to the marginalized communities, to encourage them to make and unmake the technology as part of their material struggle against oppression. Their second task is to redesign our online technology stacks to structurally expose spaces for community members to co-opt and co-construct the technology in aid of their emancipatory struggles. We operationalize Freire's theories to develop a problem-posing framework for envisioning emancipatory IA platforms of the future.]]></description>

Experimental robot optimization often requires evaluating each candidate policy for seconds to minutes. The chosen evaluation time influences optimization because of a speed-accuracy tradeoff: shorter evaluations enable faster iteration, but are also more subject to noise. Here, we introduce a supplement to the CMA-ES optimization algorithm, named Adaptive Sampling CMA-ES (AS-CMA), which assigns sampling time to candidates based on predicted sorting difficulty, aiming to achieve consistent precision. We compared AS-CMA to CMA-ES and Bayesian optimization using a range of static sampling times in four simulated cost landscapes. AS-CMA converged on 98% of all runs without adjustment to its tunable parameter, and converged 24-65% faster and with 29-76% lower total cost than each landscape's best CMA-ES static sampling time. As compared to Bayesian optimization, AS-CMA converged more efficiently and reliably in complex landscapes, while in simpler landscapes, AS-CMA was less efficient but equally reliable. We deployed AS-CMA in an exoskeleton optimization experiment and found the optimizer's behavior was consistent with expectations. These results indicate that AS-CMA can improve optimization efficiency in the presence of noise while minimally affecting optimization setup complexity and tuning requirements.]]></description>

Recent research suggests that looped Transformers have superior reasoning capabilities compared to standard deep architectures. Current approaches to training single-head looped architectures on benchmark tasks frequently fail or yield suboptimal performance due to a highly non-convex and irregular loss landscape. In these settings, optimization often stagnates in poor local minima and saddle points of the loss landscape, preventing the model from discovering the global minimum point. The internal mechanisms of these single-head looped transformer models remain poorly understood, and training them from scratch remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework that leverages Tsallis entropy and Hamiltonian dynamics to transform the geometry of the loss landscape. By treating the parameter updates as a physical flow, we successfully trained a single-head looped Transformer with model dimension $d = 8$ to solve induction head task with input sequence length of 1000 tokens. This success reveals the internal mechanism behind the superior reasoning capability.]]></description>

Handwriting remains an essential skill, particularly in education. Therefore, providing visual feedback on handwritten documents is an important but understudied area. We outline the many challenges when going from an image of handwritten input to correctly placed informative error feedback. We empirically compare modular and end-to-end systems and find that both approaches currently do not achieve acceptable overall quality. We identify the major challenges and outline an agenda for future research.]]></description>

Kernel-based methods are used in the context of Granger Causality to enable the identification of nonlinear causal relationships between time series variables. In this paper, we show that two state of the art kernel-based Granger Causality (GC) approaches can be theoretically unified under the framework of Kernel Principal Component Regression (KPCR), and introduce a method based on this unification, demonstrating that this approach can improve causal identification. Additionally, we introduce a Gaussian Process score-based model with Smooth Information Criterion penalisation on the marginal likelihood, and demonstrate improved performance over existing state of the art time-series nonlinear causal discovery methods. Furthermore, we propose a contemporaneous causal identification algorithm, fully based on GC, using the proposed score-based $GP_{SIC}$ method, and compare its performance to a state of the art contemporaneous time series causal discovery algorithm.]]></description>

In complex environments, autonomous robot navigation and environmental perception pose higher requirements for SLAM technology. This paper presents a novel method for semantically enhancing 3D point cloud maps with thermal information. By first performing pixel-level fusion of visible and infrared images, the system projects real-time LiDAR point clouds onto this fused image stream. It then segments heat source features in the thermal channel to instantly identify high temperature targets and applies this temperature information as a semantic layer on the final 3D map. This approach generates maps that not only have accurate geometry but also possess a critical semantic understanding of the environment, making it highly valuable for specific applications like rapid disaster assessment and industrial preventive maintenance.]]></description>

We study permutation (jumbled/Abelian) pattern matching over a general alphabet $Σ$. Given a pattern P of length m and a text T of length n, the classical task is to decide whether T contains a length-m substring whose Parikh vector equals that of P . While this existence problem admits a linear-time sliding-window solution, many practical applications require optimization and packing variants beyond mere detection. We present a unified sliding-window framework based on maintaining the Parikh-vector difference between P and the current window of T , enabling permutation matching in O(n + σ) time and O(σ) space, where σ = |Σ|. Building on this foundation, we introduce a combinatorial-optimization variant that we call Maximum Feasible Substring under Pattern Supply (MFSP): find the longest substring S of T whose symbol counts are component-wise bounded by those of P . We show that MFSP can also be solved in O(n + σ) time via a two-pointer feasibility maintenance algorithm, providing an exact packing interpretation of P as a resource budget. Finally, we address non-overlapping occurrence selection by modeling each permutation match as an equal-length interval and proving that a greedy earliest-finishing strategy yields a maximum-cardinality set of disjoint matches, computable in linear time once all matches are enumerated. Our results provide concise, provably correct algorithms with tight bounds, and connect frequency-based string matching to packing-style optimization primitives.]]></description>

We propose OpenVoxel, a training-free algorithm for grouping and captioning sparse voxels for the open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding tasks. Given the sparse voxel rasterization (SVR) model obtained from multi-view images of a 3D scene, our OpenVoxel is able to produce meaningful groups that describe different objects in the scene. Also, by leveraging powerful Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), our OpenVoxel successfully build an informative scene map by captioning each group, enabling further 3D scene understanding tasks such as open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) or referring expression segmentation (RES). Unlike previous methods, our method is training-free and does not introduce embeddings from a CLIP/BERT text encoder. Instead, we directly proceed with text-to-text search using MLLMs. Through extensive experiments, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to recent studies, particularly in complex referring expression segmentation (RES) tasks. The code will be open.]]></description>

Longitudinal brain MRI is essential for lifespan study, yet high attrition rates often lead to missing data, complicating analysis. Deep generative models have been explored, but most rely solely on image intensity, leading to two key limitations: 1) the fidelity or trustworthiness of the generated brain images are limited, making downstream studies questionable; 2) the usage flexibility is restricted due to fixed guidance rooted in the model structure, restricting full ability to versatile application scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DF-DiffCom, a Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)-enhanced diffusion model that smartly leverages deformation fields for trustworthy longitudinal brain image completion. Trained on OASIS-3, DF-DiffCom outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving PSNR by 5.6% and SSIM by 0.12. More importantly, its modality-agnostic nature allows smooth extension to varied MRI modalities, even to attribute maps such as brain tissue segmentation results.]]></description>

Autonomous systems conducting schema-grounded information-gathering dialogues face an instrumentation gap, lacking turn-level observables for monitoring acquisition efficiency and detecting when questioning becomes unproductive. We introduce Dialogue Telemetry (DT), a measurement framework that produces two model-agnostic signals after each question-answer exchange: (i) a Progress Estimator (PE) quantifying residual information potential per category (with a bits-based variant), and (ii) a Stalling Index (SI) detecting an observable failure signature characterized by repeated category probing with semantically similar, low-marginal-gain responses. SI flags this pattern without requiring causal diagnosis, supporting monitoring in settings where attributing degradation to specific causes may be impractical. We validate DT in controlled search-and-rescue (SAR)-inspired interviews using large language model (LLM)-based simulations, distinguishing efficient from stalled dialogue traces and illustrating downstream utility by integrating DT signals into a reinforcement learning (RL) policy. Across these settings, DT provides interpretable turn-level instrumentation that improves policy performance when stalling carries operational costs.]]></description>

Large language models typically represent Chinese characters as discrete index-based tokens, largely ignoring their visual form. For logographic scripts, visual structure carries semantic and phonetic information, which may aid prediction. We investigate whether low-resolution visual inputs can serve as an alternative for character-level modeling. Instead of token IDs, our decoder receives grayscale images of individual characters, with resolutions as low as $8 \times 8$ pixels. Remarkably, these inputs achieve 39.2\% accuracy, comparable to the index-based baseline of 39.1\%. Such low-resource settings also exhibit a pronounced \emph{hot-start} effect: by 0.4\% of total training, accuracy reaches above 12\%, while index-based models lag at below 6\%. Overall, our results demonstrate that minimal visual structure can provide a robust and efficient signal for Chinese language modeling, offering an alternative perspective on character representation that complements traditional index-based approaches.]]></description>

This paper presents SiliconHealth, a comprehensive blockchain-based healthcare infrastructure designed for resource-constrained regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa. We demonstrate that obsolete Bitcoin mining Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) can be repurposed to create a secure, low-cost, and energy-efficient medical records system. The proposed architecture employs a four-tier hierarchical network: regional hospitals using Antminer S19 Pro (90+ TH/s), urban health centers with Antminer S9 (14 TH/s), rural clinics equipped with Lucky Miner LV06 (500 GH/s, 13W), and mobile health points with portable ASIC devices. We introduce the Deterministic Hardware Fingerprinting (DHF) paradigm, which repurposes SHA-256 mining ASICs as cryptographic proof generators, achieving 100% verification rate across 23 test proofs during 300-second validation sessions. The system incorporates Reed-Solomon LSB watermarking for medical image authentication with 30-40% damage tolerance, semantic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for intelligent medical record queries, and offline synchronization protocols for intermittent connectivity. Economic analysis demonstrates 96% cost reduction compared to GPU-based alternatives, with total deployment cost of $847 per rural clinic including 5-year solar power infrastructure. Validation experiments on Lucky Miner LV06 (BM1366 chip, 5nm) achieve 2.93 MH/W efficiency and confirm hardware universality. This work establishes a practical framework for deploying verifiable, tamper-proof electronic health records in regions where traditional healthcare IT infrastructure is economically unfeasible, potentially benefiting over 600 million people lacking access to basic health information systems.]]></description>

Microscaling Floating-Point (MXFP) has emerged as a promising low-precision format for large language models (LLMs). Despite various post-training quantization (PTQ) algorithms being proposed, they mostly focus on integer quantization, while their applicability and behavior under MXFP formats remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, this work conducts a systematic investigation of PTQ under MXFP formats, encompassing over 7 PTQ algorithms, 15 evaluation benchmarks, and 3 LLM families. The key findings include: 1) MXFP8 consistently achieves near-lossless performance, while MXFP4 introduces substantial accuracy degradation and remains challenging; 2) PTQ effectiveness under MXFP depends strongly on format compatibility, with some algorithmic paradigms being consistently more effective than others; 3) PTQ performance exhibits highly consistent trends across model families and modalities, in particular, quantization sensitivity is dominated by the language model rather than the vision encoder in multimodal LLMs; 4) The scaling factor of quantization is a critical error source in MXFP4, and a simple pre-scale optimization strategy can significantly mitigate its impact. Together, these results provide practical guidance on adapting existing PTQ methods to MXFP quantization.]]></description>

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are making significant progress in multimodal reasoning. Early approaches focus on pure text-based reasoning. More recent studies have incorporated multimodal information into the reasoning steps; however, they often follow a single task-specific reasoning pattern, which limits their generalizability across various multimodal tasks. In fact, there are numerous multimodal tasks requiring diverse reasoning skills, such as zooming in on a specific region or marking an object within an image. To address this, we propose unified generative multimodal reasoning, which unifies diverse multimodal reasoning skills by generating intermediate images during the reasoning process. We instantiate this paradigm with Omni-R1, a two-stage SFT+RL framework featuring perception alignment loss and perception reward, thereby enabling functional image generation. Additionally, we introduce Omni-R1-Zero, which eliminates the need for multimodal annotations by bootstrapping step-wise visualizations from text-only reasoning data. Empirical results show that Omni-R1 achieves unified generative reasoning across a wide range of multimodal tasks, and Omni-R1-Zero can match or even surpass Omni-R1 on average, suggesting a promising direction for generative multimodal reasoning.]]></description>

The energy transition challenges operational tasks based on simulations and optimisation. These computations need to be fast and flexible as the grid is ever-expanding, and renewables' uncertainty requires a flexible operational environment. Learned approximations, proxies or surrogates -- we refer to them as Neural Solvers -- excel in terms of evaluation speed, but are inflexible with respect to adjusting to changing tasks. Hence, neural solvers are usually applicable to highly specific tasks, which limits their usefulness in practice; a widely reusable, foundational neural solver is required. Therefore, this work proposes the Residual Power Flow (RPF) formulation. RPF formulates residual functions based on Kirchhoff's laws to quantify the infeasibility of an operating condition. The minimisation of the residuals determines the voltage solution; an additional slack variable is needed to achieve AC-feasibility. RPF forms a natural, foundational subtask of tasks subject to power flow constraints. We propose to learn RPF with neural solvers to exploit their speed. Furthermore, RPF improves learning performance compared to common power flow formulations. To solve operational tasks, we integrate the neural solver in a Predict-then-Optimise (PO) approach to combine speed and flexibility. The case study investigates the IEEE 9-bus system and three tasks (AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF), power-flow and quasi-steady state power flow) solved by PO. The results demonstrate the accuracy and flexibility of learning with RPF.]]></description>

We explore a situation in which the target domain is accessible, but real-time data annotation is not feasible. Instead, we would like to construct an alternative training set from a large-scale data server so that a competitive model can be obtained. For this problem, because the target domain usually exhibits distinct modes (i.e., semantic clusters representing data distribution), if the training set does not contain these target modes, the model performance would be compromised. While prior existing works improve algorithms iteratively, our research explores the often-overlooked potential of optimizing the structure of the data server. Inspired by the hierarchical nature of web search engines, we introduce a hierarchical data server, together with a bipartite mode matching algorithm (BMM) to align source and target modes. For each target mode, we look in the server data tree for the best mode match, which might be large or small in size. Through bipartite matching, we aim for all target modes to be optimally matched with source modes in a one-on-one fashion. Compared with existing training set search algorithms, we show that the matched server modes constitute training sets that have consistently smaller domain gaps with the target domain across object re-identification (re-ID) and detection tasks. Consequently, models trained on our searched training sets have higher accuracy than those trained otherwise. BMM allows data-centric unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) orthogonal to existing model-centric UDA methods. By combining the BMM with existing UDA methods like pseudo-labeling, further improvement is observed.]]></description>

Egocentric Human-Object Interaction (EHOI) analysis is crucial for industrial safety, yet the development of robust models is hindered by the scarcity of annotated domain-specific data. We address this challenge by introducing a data generation framework that combines synthetic data with a diffusion-based process to augment real-world images with realistic Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). We present GlovEgo-HOI, a new benchmark dataset for industrial EHOI, and GlovEgo-Net, a model integrating Glove-Head and Keypoint- Head modules to leverage hand pose information for enhanced interaction detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed data generation framework and GlovEgo-Net. To foster further research, we release the GlovEgo-HOI dataset, augmentation pipeline, and pre-trained models at: GitHub project.]]></description>

SMEs increasingly seek alternatives to cloud LLM APIs, which raise data privacy concerns. Dedicated cloud GPU instances offer improved privacy but with limited guarantees and ongoing costs, while professional on-premise hardware (A100, H100) remains prohibitively expensive. We present a systematic evaluation of NVIDIA's Blackwell consumer GPUs (RTX 5060 Ti, 5070 Ti, 5090) for production LLM inference, benchmarking four open-weight models (Qwen3-8B, Gemma3-12B, Gemma3-27B, GPT-OSS-20B) across 79 configurations spanning quantization formats (BF16, W4A16, NVFP4, MXFP4), context lengths (8k-64k), and three workloads: RAG, multi-LoRA agentic serving, and high-concurrency APIs. The RTX 5090 delivers 3.5-4.6x higher throughput than the 5060 Ti with 21x lower latency for RAG, but budget GPUs achieve the highest throughput-per-dollar for API workloads with sub-second latency. NVFP4 quantization provides 1.6x throughput over BF16 with 41% energy reduction and only 2-4% quality loss. Self-hosted inference costs $0.001-0.04 per million tokens (electricity only), which is 40-200x cheaper than budget-tier cloud APIs, with hardware breaking even in under four months at moderate volume (30M tokens/day). Our results show that consumer GPUs can reliably replace cloud inference for most SME workloads, except latency-critical long-context RAG, where high-end GPUs remain essential. We provide deployment guidance and release all benchmark data for reproducible SME-scale deployments.]]></description>

This paper introduces a novel application of Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPAs) for Facial Expression Recognition (FER). Departing from conventional pre-training methods for video understanding that rely on pixel-level reconstructions, V-JEPAs learn by predicting embeddings of masked regions from the embeddings of unmasked regions. This enables the trained encoder to not capture irrelevant information about a given video like the color of a region of pixels in the background. Using a pre-trained V-JEPA video encoder, we train shallow classifiers using the RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on RAVDESS and outperforming all other vision-based methods on CREMA-D (+1.48 WAR). Furthermore, cross-dataset evaluations reveal strong generalization capabilities, demonstrating the potential of purely embedding-based pre-training approaches to advance FER. We release our code at https://github.com/lennarteingunia/vjepa-for-fer.]]></description>

Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across a variety of tasks, yet they often suffer from unreliable probability estimates. As a result, they can be overconfident in their predictions. Conformal Prediction (CP) offers a principled framework for uncertainty quantification, yielding prediction sets with rigorous coverage guarantees. Existing conformal training methods optimize for overall set size, but shaping the prediction sets in a class-conditional manner is not straightforward and typically requires prior knowledge of the data distribution. In this work, we introduce Class Adaptive Conformal Training (CaCT), which formulates conformal training as an augmented Lagrangian optimization problem that adaptively learns to shape prediction sets class-conditionally without making any distributional assumptions. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, including standard and long-tailed image recognition as well as text classification, demonstrate that CaCT consistently outperforms prior conformal training methods, producing significantly smaller and more informative prediction sets while maintaining the desired coverage guarantees.]]></description>

Deep learning models define the state-of-the-art in Automatic Drum Transcription (ADT), yet their performance is contingent upon large-scale, paired audio-MIDI datasets, which are scarce. Existing workarounds that use synthetic data often introduce a significant domain gap, as they typically rely on low-fidelity SoundFont libraries that lack acoustic diversity. While high-quality one-shot samples offer a better alternative, they are not available in a standardized, large-scale format suitable for training. This paper introduces a new paradigm for ADT that circumvents the need for paired audio-MIDI training data. Our primary contribution is a semi-supervised method to automatically curate a large and diverse corpus of one-shot drum samples from unlabeled audio sources. We then use this corpus to synthesize a high-quality dataset from MIDI files alone, which we use to train a sequence-to-sequence transcription model. We evaluate our model on the ENST and MDB test sets, where it achieves new state-of-the-art results, significantly outperforming both fully supervised methods and previous synthetic-data approaches. The code for reproducing our experiments is publicly available at https://github.com/pier-maker92/ADT_STR]]></description>

Enabling humanoid robots to physically interact with humans is a critical frontier, but progress is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality Human-Humanoid Interaction (HHoI) data. While leveraging abundant Human-Human Interaction (HHI) data presents a scalable alternative, we first demonstrate that standard retargeting fails by breaking the essential contacts. We address this with PAIR (Physics-Aware Interaction Retargeting), a contact-centric, two-stage pipeline that preserves contact semantics across morphology differences to generate physically consistent HHoI data. This high-quality data, however, exposes a second failure: conventional imitation learning policies merely mimic trajectories and lack interactive understanding. We therefore introduce D-STAR (Decoupled Spatio-Temporal Action Reasoner), a hierarchical policy that disentangles when to act from where to act. In D-STAR, Phase Attention (when) and a Multi-Scale Spatial module (where) are fused by the diffusion head to produce synchronized whole-body behaviors beyond mimicry. By decoupling these reasoning streams, our model learns robust temporal phases without being distracted by spatial noise, leading to responsive, synchronized collaboration. We validate our framework through extensive and rigorous simulations, demonstrating significant performance gains over baseline approaches and a complete, effective pipeline for learning complex whole-body interactions from HHI data.]]></description>

Due to the dynamically evolving nature of real-world query streams, relevance models struggle to generalize to practical search scenarios. A sophisticated solution is self-evolution techniques. However, in large-scale industrial settings with massive query streams, this technique faces two challenges: (1) informative samples are often sparse and difficult to identify, and (2) pseudo-labels generated by the current model could be unreliable. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose a Self-Evolving Relevance Model approach (SERM), which comprises two complementary multi-agent modules: a multi-agent sample miner, designed to detect distributional shifts and identify informative training samples, and a multi-agent relevance annotator, which provides reliable labels through a two-level agreement framework. We evaluate SERM in a large-scale industrial setting, which serves billions of user requests daily. Experimental results demonstrate that SERM can achieve significant performance gains through iterative self-evolution, as validated by extensive offline multilingual evaluations and online testing.]]></description>

To teach robots complex manipulation tasks, it is now a common practice to fine-tune a pre-trained vision-language-action model (VLA) on task-specific data. However, since this recipe updates existing representations, it is unsuitable for long-term operation in the real world, where robots must continually adapt to new tasks and environments while retaining the knowledge they have already acquired. Existing continual learning methods for robotics commonly require storing previous data (exemplars), struggle with long task sequences, or rely on task identifiers for deployment. To address these limitations, we propose CLARE, a general, parameter-efficient framework for exemplar-free continual learning with VLAs. CLARE introduces lightweight modular adapters into selected feedforward layers and autonomously expands the model only where necessary when learning a new task, guided by layer-wise feature similarity. During deployment, an autoencoder-based routing mechanism dynamically activates the most relevant adapters without requiring task labels. Through extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark, we show that CLARE achieves high performance on new tasks without catastrophic forgetting of earlier tasks, significantly outperforming even exemplar-based methods. Code and data are available at https://tum-lsy.github.io/clare.]]></description>

Scientific surveys require not only summarizing large bodies of literature, but also organizing them into clear and coherent conceptual structures. Existing automatic survey generation methods typically focus on linear text generation and struggle to explicitly model hierarchical relations among research topics and structured methodological comparisons, resulting in gaps in structural organization compared to expert-written surveys. We propose MVSS, a multi-view structured survey generation framework that jointly generates and aligns citation-grounded hierarchical trees, structured comparison tables, and survey text. MVSS follows a structure-first paradigm: it first constructs a conceptual tree of the research domain, then generates comparison tables constrained by the tree, and finally uses both as structural constraints for text generation. This enables complementary multi-view representations across structure, comparison, and narrative. We introduce an evaluation framework assessing structural quality, comparative completeness, and citation fidelity. Experiments on 76 computer science topics show MVSS outperforms existing methods in organization and evidence grounding, achieving performance comparable to expert surveys.]]></description>

Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex decision-making and tool-use tasks, yet their ability to generalize across varying environments remains a under-examined concern. Current evaluation paradigms predominantly rely on trajectory-based metrics that measure task success, while failing to assess whether agents possess a grounded, transferable model of the environment. To address this gap, we propose Task-to-Quiz (T2Q), a deterministic and automated evaluation paradigm designed to decouple task execution from world-state understanding. We instantiate this paradigm in T2QBench, a suite comprising 30 environments and 1,967 grounded QA pairs across multiple difficulty levels. Our extensive experiments reveal that task success is often a poor proxy for environment understanding, and that current memory machanism can not effectively help agents acquire a grounded model of the environment. These findings identify proactive exploration and fine-grained state representation as primary bottlenecks, offering a robust foundation for developing more generalizable autonomous agents.]]></description>

Powerful 3D representations such as DUSt3R invariant point maps, which encode 3D shape and camera parameters, have significantly advanced feed forward 3D reconstruction. While point maps assume static scenes, Dynamic Point Maps (DPMs) extend this concept to dynamic 3D content by additionally representing scene motion. However, existing DPMs are limited to image pairs and, like DUSt3R, require post processing via optimization when more than two views are involved. We argue that DPMs are more useful when applied to videos and introduce V-DPM to demonstrate this. First, we show how to formulate DPMs for video input in a way that maximizes representational power, facilitates neural prediction, and enables reuse of pretrained models. Second, we implement these ideas on top of VGGT, a recent and powerful 3D reconstructor. Although VGGT was trained on static scenes, we show that a modest amount of synthetic data is sufficient to adapt it into an effective V-DPM predictor. Our approach achieves state of the art performance in 3D and 4D reconstruction for dynamic scenes. In particular, unlike recent dynamic extensions of VGGT such as P3, DPMs recover not only dynamic depth but also the full 3D motion of every point in the scene.]]></description>

Object detectors often perform well in-distribution, yet degrade sharply on a different benchmark. We study cross-dataset object detection (CD-OD) through a lens of setting specificity. We group benchmarks into setting-agnostic datasets with diverse everyday scenes and setting-specific datasets tied to a narrow environment, and evaluate a standard detector family across all train--test pairs. This reveals a clear structure in CD-OD: transfer within the same setting type is relatively stable, while transfer across setting types drops substantially and is often asymmetric. The most severe breakdowns occur when transferring from specific sources to agnostic targets, and persist after open-label alignment, indicating that domain shift dominates in the hardest regimes. To disentangle domain shift from label mismatch, we compare closed-label transfer with an open-label protocol that maps predicted classes to the nearest target label using CLIP similarity. Open-label evaluation yields consistent but bounded gains, and many corrected cases correspond to semantic near-misses supported by the image evidence. Overall, we provide a principled characterization of CD-OD under setting specificity and practical guidance for evaluating detectors under distribution shift. Code will be released at \href{[https://github.com/Ritabrata04/cdod-icpr.git}{https://github.com/Ritabrata04/cdod-icpr}.]]></description>

With the emergence of massively parallel processing units, parallelization has become a desirable property for new sequence models. The ability to parallelize the processing of sequences with respect to the sequence length during training is one of the main factors behind the uprising of the Transformer architecture. However, Transformers lack efficiency at sequence generation, as they need to reprocess all past timesteps at every generation step. Recently, state-space models (SSMs) emerged as a more efficient alternative. These new kinds of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) keep the efficient update of the RNNs while gaining parallelization by getting rid of nonlinear dynamics (or recurrence). SSMs can reach state-of-the art performance through the efficient training of potentially very large networks, but still suffer from limited representation capabilities. In particular, SSMs cannot exhibit persistent memory, or the capacity of retaining information for an infinite duration, because of their monostability. In this paper, we introduce a new family of RNNs, the memory recurrent units (MRUs), that combine the persistent memory capabilities of nonlinear RNNs with the parallelizable computations of SSMs. These units leverage multistability as a source of persistent memory, while getting rid of transient dynamics for efficient computations. We then derive a specific implementation as proof-of-concept: the bistable memory recurrent unit (BMRU). This new RNN is compatible with the parallel scan algorithm. We show that BMRU achieves good results in tasks with long-term dependencies, and can be combined with state-space models to create hybrid networks that are parallelizable and have transient dynamics as well as persistent memory.]]></description>

Deep Operator Networks are emerging as fundamental tools among various neural network types to learn mappings between function spaces, and have recently gained attention due to their ability to approximate nonlinear operators. In particular, DeepONets offer a natural formulation for PDE solving, since the solution of a partial differential equation can be interpreted as an operator mapping an initial condition to its corresponding solution field. In this work, we applied DeepONets in the context of process modeling for adsorption technologies, to assess their feasibility as surrogates for cyclic adsorption process simulation and optimization. The goal is to accelerate convergence of cyclic processes such as Temperature-Vacuum Swing Adsorption (TVSA), which require repeated solution of transient PDEs, which are computationally expensive. Since each step of a cyclic adsorption process starts from the final state of the preceding step, effective surrogate modeling requires generalization across a wide range of initial conditions. The governing equations exhibit steep traveling fronts, providing a demanding benchmark for operator learning. To evaluate functional generalization under these conditions, we construct a mixed training dataset composed of heterogeneous initial conditions and train DeepONets to approximate the corresponding solution operators. The trained models are then tested on initial conditions outside the parameter ranges used during training, as well as on completely unseen functional forms. The results demonstrate accurate predictions both within and beyond the training distribution, highlighting DeepONets as potential efficient surrogates for accelerating cyclic adsorption simulations and optimization workflows.]]></description>

The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has fostered diverse paradigms for automated slide generation, ranging from code-driven layouts to image-centric synthesis. However, evaluating these heterogeneous systems remains challenging, as existing protocols often struggle to provide comparable scores across architectures or rely on uncalibrated judgments. In this paper, we introduce SlidesGen-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate slide generation through a lens of three core principles: universality, quantification, and reliability. First, to establish a unified evaluation framework, we ground our analysis in the visual domain, treating terminal outputs as renderings to remain agnostic to the underlying generation method. Second, we propose a computational approach that quantitatively assesses slides across three distinct dimensions - Content, Aesthetics, and Editability - offering reproducible metrics where prior works relied on subjective or reference-dependent proxies. Finally, to ensure high correlation with human preference, we construct the Slides-Align1.5k dataset, a human preference aligned dataset covering slides from nine mainstream generation systems across seven scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that SlidesGen-Bench achieves a higher degree of alignment with human judgment than existing evaluation pipelines. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/YunqiaoYang/SlidesGen-Bench.]]></description>

Semantic understanding of popularity bias is a crucial yet underexplored challenge in recommender systems, where popular items are often favored at the expense of niche content. Most existing debiasing methods treat the semantic understanding of popularity bias as a matter of diversity enhancement or long-tail coverage, neglecting the deeper semantic layer that embodies the causal origins of the bias itself. Consequently, such shallow interpretations limit both their debiasing effectiveness and recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose FairLRM, a novel framework that bridges the gap in the semantic understanding of popularity bias with Recommendation via Large Language Model (RecLLM). FairLRM decomposes popularity bias into item-side and user-side components, using structured instruction-based prompts to enhance the model's comprehension of both global item distributions and individual user preferences. Unlike traditional methods that rely on surface-level features such as "diversity" or "debiasing", FairLRM improves the model's ability to semantically interpret and address the underlying bias. Through empirical evaluation, we show that FairLRM significantly enhances both fairness and recommendation accuracy, providing a more semantically aware and trustworthy approach to enhance the semantic understanding of popularity bias. The implementation is available at https://github.com/LuoRenqiang/FairLRM.]]></description>

We address the problem of sampling from terminally constrained distributions with pre-trained flow-based generative models through an optimal control formulation. Theoretically, we characterize the value function by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and derive the optimal feedback control as the minimizer of the associated Hamiltonian. We show that as the control penalty increases, the controlled process recovers the reference distribution, while as the penalty vanishes, the terminal law converges to a generalized Wasserstein projection onto the constraint manifold. Algorithmically, we introduce Terminal Optimal Control with Flow-based models (TOCFlow), a geometry-aware sampling-time guidance method for pre-trained flows. Solving the control problem in a terminal co-moving frame that tracks reference trajectories yields a closed-form scalar damping factor along the Riemannian gradient, capturing second-order curvature effects without matrix inversions. TOCFlow therefore matches the geometric consistency of Gauss-Newton updates at the computational cost of standard gradient guidance. We evaluate TOCFlow on three high-dimensional scientific tasks spanning equality, inequality, and global statistical constraints, namely Darcy flow, constrained trajectory planning, and turbulence snapshot generation with Kolmogorov spectral scaling. Across all settings, TOCFlow improves constraint satisfaction over Euclidean guidance and projection baselines while preserving the reference model's generative quality.]]></description>

Model merging enables multiple large language models (LLMs) to be combined into a single model while preserving performance. This makes it a valuable tool in LLM development, offering a competitive alternative to multi-task training. However, merging can be difficult at scale, as successful merging requires choosing the right merge operator, selecting the right models, and merging them in the right order. This often leads researchers to run expensive merge-and-evaluate searches to select the best merge. In this work, we provide an alternative by introducing \simmerge{}, \emph{a predictive merge-selection method} that selects the best merge using inexpensive, task-agnostic similarity signals between models. From a small set of unlabeled probes, we compute functional and structural features and use them to predict the performance of a given 2-way merge. Using these predictions, \simmerge{} selects the best merge operator, the subset of models to merge, and the merge order, eliminating the expensive merge-and-evaluate loop. We demonstrate that we surpass standard merge-operator performance on 2-way merges of 7B-parameter LLMs, and that \simmerge{} generalizes to multi-way merges and 111B-parameter LLM merges without retraining. Additionally, we present a bandit variant that supports adding new tasks, models, and operators on the fly. Our results suggest that learning how to merge is a practical route to scalable model composition when checkpoint catalogs are large and evaluation budgets are tight.]]></description>

Multiple external representations (MERs) and personalized feedback support physics learning, yet evidence on how personalized feedback can effectively integrate MERs remains limited. This question is particularly timely given the emergence of multimodal large language models. We conducted a 16-24 week observational study in high school physics (N=661) using a computer-based platform that provided verification and optional elaborated feedback in verbal, graphical and mathematical forms. Linear mixed-effects models and strategy-cluster analyses (ANCOVA-adjusted comparisons) tested associations between feedback use and post-test performance and moderation by representational competence. Elaborated multirepresentational feedback showed a small but consistent positive association with post-test scores independent of prior knowledge and confidence. Learners adopted distinct representation-selection strategies; among students with lower representational competence, using a diverse set of representations related to higher learning, whereas this advantage diminished as competence increased. These findings motivate adaptive feedback designs and inform intelligent tutoring systems capable of tailoring feedback elaboration and representational format to learner profiles, advancing personalized instruction in physics education.]]></description>

Graph unlearning has emerged as a critical mechanism for supporting sustainable and privacy-preserving social networks, enabling models to remove the influence of deleted nodes and thereby better safeguard user information. However, we observe that existing graph unlearning techniques insufficiently protect sensitive attributes, often leading to degraded algorithmic fairness compared with traditional graph learning methods. To address this gap, we introduce FairGU, a fairness-aware graph unlearning framework designed to preserve both utility and fairness during the unlearning process. FairGU integrates a dedicated fairness-aware module with effective data protection strategies, ensuring that sensitive attributes are neither inadvertently amplified nor structurally exposed when nodes are removed. Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, we demonstrate that FairGU consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph unlearning methods and fairness-enhanced graph learning baselines in terms of both accuracy and fairness metrics. Our findings highlight a previously overlooked risk in current unlearning practices and establish FairGU as a robust and equitable solution for the next generation of socially sustainable networked systems. The codes are available at https://github.com/LuoRenqiang/FairGU.]]></description>

Topographic models are essential for characterizing planetary surfaces and for inferring underlying geological processes. Nevertheless, meter-scale topographic data remain limited, which constrains detailed planetary investigations, even for the Moon, where extensive high-resolution orbital images are available. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) exploit single-view imagery, constrained by low-resolution topography, for fast and flexible reconstruction of fine-scale topography. However, their robustness and general applicability across diverse lunar landforms and illumination conditions remain insufficiently explored. In this study, we build upon our previously proposed DL framework by incorporating a more robust scale recovery scheme and extending the model to polar regions under low solar illumination conditions. We demonstrate that, compared with single-view shape-from-shading methods, the proposed DL approach exhibits greater robustness to varying illumination and achieves more consistent and accurate topographic reconstructions. Furthermore, it reliably reconstructs topography across lunar features of diverse scales, morphologies, and geological ages. High-quality topographic models are also produced for the lunar south polar areas, including permanently shadowed regions, demonstrating the method's capability in reconstructing complex and low-illumination terrain. These findings suggest that DL-based approaches have the potential to leverage extensive lunar datasets to support advanced exploration missions and enable investigations of the Moon at unprecedented topographic resolution.]]></description>

Accurate global medium-range weather forecasting is fundamental to Earth system science. Most existing Transformer-based forecasting models adopt vision-centric architectures that neglect the Earth's spherical geometry and zonal periodicity. In addition, conventional autoregressive training is computationally expensive and limits forecast horizons due to error accumulation. To address these challenges, we propose the Shifted Earth Transformer (Searth Transformer), a physics-informed architecture that incorporates zonal periodicity and meridional boundaries into window-based self-attention for physically consistent global information exchange. We further introduce a Relay Autoregressive (RAR) fine-tuning strategy that enables learning long-range atmospheric evolution under constrained memory and computational budgets. Based on these methods, we develop YanTian, a global medium-range weather forecasting model. YanTian achieves higher accuracy than the high-resolution forecast of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and performs competitively with state-of-the-art AI models at one-degree resolution, while requiring roughly 200 times lower computational cost than standard autoregressive fine-tuning. Furthermore, YanTian attains a longer skillful forecast lead time for Z500 (10.3 days) than HRES (9 days). Beyond weather forecasting, this work establishes a robust algorithmic foundation for predictive modeling of complex global-scale geophysical circulation systems, offering new pathways for Earth system science.]]></description>

While LLM-based agents have shown promise for deep research, most existing approaches rely on fixed workflows that struggle to adapt to real-world, open-ended queries. Recent work therefore explores self-evolution by allowing agents to rewrite their own code or prompts to improve problem-solving ability, but unconstrained optimization often triggers instability, hallucinations, and instruction drift. We propose EvoFSM, a structured self-evolving framework that achieves both adaptability and control by evolving an explicit Finite State Machine (FSM) instead of relying on free-form rewriting. EvoFSM decouples the optimization space into macroscopic Flow (state-transition logic) and microscopic Skill (state-specific behaviors), enabling targeted improvements under clear behavioral boundaries. Guided by a critic mechanism, EvoFSM refines the FSM through a small set of constrained operations, and further incorporates a self-evolving memory that distills successful trajectories as reusable priors and failure patterns as constraints for future queries. Extensive evaluations on five multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EvoFSM. In particular, EvoFSM reaches 58.0% accuracy on the DeepSearch benchmark. Additional results on interactive decision-making tasks further validate its generalization.]]></description>

In collaborative learning (CL), multiple parties jointly train a machine learning model on their private datasets. However, data can not be shared directly due to privacy concerns. To ensure input confidentiality, cryptographic techniques, e.g., multi-party computation (MPC), enable training on encrypted data. Yet, even securely trained models are vulnerable to inference attacks aiming to extract memorized data from model outputs. To ensure output privacy and mitigate inference attacks, differential privacy (DP) injects calibrated noise during training. While cryptography and DP offer complementary guarantees, combining them efficiently for cryptographic and differentially private CL (CPCL) is challenging. Cryptography incurs performance overheads, while DP degrades accuracy, creating a privacy-accuracy-performance trade-off that needs careful design considerations. This work systematizes the CPCL landscape. We introduce a unified framework that generalizes common phases across CPCL paradigms, and identify secure noise sampling as the foundational phase to achieve CPCL. We analyze trade-offs of different secure noise sampling techniques, noise types, and DP mechanisms discussing their implementation challenges and evaluating their accuracy and cryptographic overhead across CPCL paradigms. Additionally, we implement identified secure noise sampling options in MPC and evaluate their computation and communication costs in WAN and LAN. Finally, we propose future research directions based on identified key observations, gaps and possible enhancements in the literature.]]></description>

Judicial reasoning in copyright damage awards poses a core challenge for computational legal analysis. Although federal courts follow the 1976 Copyright Act, their interpretations and factor weightings vary widely across jurisdictions. This inconsistency creates unpredictability for litigants and obscures the empirical basis of legal decisions. This research introduces a novel discourse-based Large Language Model (LLM) methodology that integrates Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) with an agentic workflow to extract and quantify previously opaque reasoning patterns from judicial opinions. Our framework addresses a major gap in empirical legal scholarship by parsing opinions into hierarchical discourse structures and using a three-stage pipeline, i.e., Dataset Construction, Discourse Analysis, and Agentic Feature Extraction. This pipeline identifies reasoning components and extract feature labels with corresponding discourse subtrees. In analyzing copyright damage rulings, we show that discourse-augmented LLM analysis outperforms traditional methods while uncovering unquantified variations in factor weighting across circuits. These findings offer both methodological advances in computational legal analysis and practical insights into judicial reasoning, with implications for legal practitioners seeking predictive tools, scholars studying legal principle application, and policymakers confronting inconsistencies in copyright law.]]></description>

Providing clear explanations to the choices of machine learning models is essential for these models to be deployed in crucial applications. Counterfactual and semi-factual explanations have emerged as two mechanisms for providing users with insights into the outputs of their models. We provide an overview of the computational complexity results in the literature for generating these explanations, finding that in many cases, generating explanations is computationally hard. We strengthen the argument for this considerably by further contributing our own inapproximability results showing that not only are explanations often hard to generate, but under certain assumptions, they are also hard to approximate. We discuss the implications of these complexity results for the XAI community and for policymakers seeking to regulate explanations in AI.]]></description>

Recent video diffusion models generate photorealistic, temporally coherent videos, yet they fall short as reliable world models for autonomous driving, where structured motion and physically consistent interactions are essential. Adapting these generalist video models to driving domains has shown promise but typically requires massive domain-specific data and costly fine-tuning. We propose an efficient adaptation framework that converts generalist video diffusion models into controllable driving world models with minimal supervision. The key idea is to decouple motion learning from appearance synthesis. First, the model is adapted to predict structured motion in a simplified form: videos of skeletonized agents and scene elements, focusing learning on physical and social plausibility. Then, the same backbone is reused to synthesize realistic RGB videos conditioned on these motion sequences, effectively "dressing" the motion with texture and lighting. This two-stage process mirrors a reasoning-rendering paradigm: first infer dynamics, then render appearance. Our experiments show this decoupled approach is exceptionally efficient: adapting SVD, we match prior SOTA models with less than 6% of their compute. Scaling to LTX, our MAD-LTX model outperforms all open-source competitors, and supports a comprehensive suite of text, ego, and object controls.

We propose Quamba-SE, a soft-edge quantizer for State Space Model (SSM) activation quantization. Unlike existing methods, using standard INT8 operation, Quamba-SE employs three adaptive scales: high-precision for small values, standard scale for normal values, and low-precision for outliers. This preserves outlier information instead of hard clipping, while maintaining precision for other values. We evaluate on Mamba- 130M across 6 zero-shot benchmarks. Results show that Quamba- SE consistently outperforms Quamba, achieving up to +2.68% on individual benchmarks and up to +0.83% improvement in the average accuracy of 6 datasets.]]></description>

We present PrivLEX, a novel image privacy classifier that grounds its decisions in legally defined personal data concepts. PrivLEX is the first interpretable privacy classifier aligned with legal concepts that leverages the recognition capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). PrivLEX relies on zero-shot VLM concept detection to provide interpretable classification through a label-free Concept Bottleneck Model, without requiring explicit concept labels during training. We demonstrate PrivLEX's ability to identify personal data concepts that are present in images. We further analyse the sensitivity of such concepts as perceived by human annotators of image privacy datasets.]]></description>

Conventional audio equalization is a static process that requires manual and cumbersome adjustments to adapt to changing listening contexts (e.g., mood, location, or social setting). In this paper, we introduce a Large Language Model (LLM)-based alternative that maps natural language text prompts to equalization settings. This enables a conversational approach to sound system control. By utilizing data collected from a controlled listening experiment, our models exploit in-context learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to reliably align with population-preferred equalization settings. Our evaluation methods, which leverage distributional metrics that capture users' varied preferences, show statistically significant improvements in distributional alignment over random sampling and static preset baselines. These results indicate that LLMs could function as "artificial equalizers," contributing to the development of more accessible, context-aware, and expert-level audio tuning methods.]]></description>

The use of formal language for deductive logical reasoning aligns well with language models (LMs), where translating natural language (NL) into first-order logic (FOL) and employing an external solver results in a verifiable and therefore reliable reasoning system. However, smaller LMs often struggle with this translation task, frequently producing incorrect symbolic outputs due to formatting and translation errors. Existing approaches typically rely on self-iteration to correct these errors, but such methods depend heavily on the capabilities of the underlying model. To address this, we first categorize common errors and fine-tune smaller LMs using data synthesized by large language models. The evaluation is performed using the defined error categories. We introduce incremental inference, which divides inference into two stages, predicate generation and FOL translation, providing greater control over model behavior and enhancing generation quality as measured by predicate metrics. This decomposition framework also enables the use of a verification module that targets predicate-arity errors to further improve performance. Our study evaluates three families of models across four logical-reasoning datasets. The comprehensive fine-tuning, incremental inference, and verification modules reduce error rates, increase predicate coverage, and improve reasoning performance for smaller LMs, moving us closer to developing reliable and accessible symbolic-reasoning systems.]]></description>

In language models (LMs), intra-memory knowledge conflict largely arises when inconsistent information about the same event is encoded within the model's parametric knowledge. While prior work has primarily focused on resolving conflicts between a model's internal knowledge and external resources through approaches such as fine-tuning or knowledge editing, the problem of localizing conflicts that originate during pre-training within the model's internal representations remain unexplored. In this work, we design a framework based on mechanistic interpretability methods to identify where and how conflicting knowledge from the pre-training data is encoded within LMs. Our findings contribute to a growing body of evidence that specific internal components of a language model are responsible for encoding conflicting knowledge from pre-training, and we demonstrate how mechanistic interpretability methods can be leveraged to causally intervene in and control conflicting knowledge at inference time.]]></description>

In optoacoustic imaging, recovering the absorption coefficients of tissue by inverting the light transport remains a challenging problem. Improvements in solving this problem can greatly benefit the clinical value of optoacoustic imaging. Existing variational inversion methods require an accurate and differentiable model of this light transport. As neural surrogate models allow fast and differentiable simulations of complex physical processes, they are considered promising candidates to be used in solving such inverse problems. However, there are in general no guarantees that the derivatives of these surrogate models accurately match those of the underlying physical operator. As accurate derivatives are central to solving inverse problems, errors in the model derivative can considerably hinder high fidelity reconstructions. To overcome this limitation, we present a surrogate model for light transport in tissue that uses Sobolev training to improve the accuracy of the model derivatives. Additionally, the form of Sobolev training we used is suitable for high-dimensional models in general. Our results demonstrate that Sobolev training for a light transport surrogate model not only improves derivative accuracy but also reduces generalization error for in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples. These improvements promise to considerably enhance the utility of the surrogate model in downstream tasks, especially in solving inverse problems.]]></description>

Automated analysis of ancient coins has the potential to help researchers extract more historical insights from large collections of coins and to help collectors understand what they are buying or selling. Recent research in this area has shown promise in focusing on identification of semantic elements as they are commonly depicted on ancient coins, by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This paper is the first to apply the recently proposed Vision Transformer (ViT) deep learning architecture to the task of identification of semantic elements on coins, using fully automatic learning from multi-modal data (images and unstructured text). This article summarises previous research in the area, discusses the training and implementation of ViT and CNN models for ancient coins analysis and provides an evaluation of their performance. The ViT models were found to outperform the newly trained CNN models in accuracy.]]></description>

Spatial reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), drawing increasing attention and rapid advancement. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on single-step perception-to-judgment tasks, leaving scenarios requiring complex visual-spatial logical chains significantly underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-MSR, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate Multi-hop Spatial Reasoning (MSR) in dynamic video scenarios. Video-MSR systematically probes MSR capabilities through four distinct tasks: Constrained Localization, Chain-based Reference Retrieval, Route Planning, and Counterfactual Physical Deduction. Our benchmark comprises 3,052 high-quality video instances with 4,993 question-answer pairs, constructed via a scalable, visually-grounded pipeline combining advanced model generation with rigorous human verification. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations, revealing that while models demonstrate proficiency in surface-level perception, they exhibit distinct performance drops in MSR tasks, frequently suffering from spatial disorientation and hallucination during multi-step deductions. To mitigate these shortcomings and empower models with stronger MSR capabilities, we further curate MSR-9K, a specialized instruction-tuning dataset, and fine-tune Qwen-VL, achieving a +7.82% absolute improvement on Video-MSR. Our results underscore the efficacy of multi-hop spatial instruction data and establish Video-MSR as a vital foundation for future research. The code and data will be available at https://github.com/ruiz-nju/Video-MSR.]]></description>

We introduce a new method of generating Computer Aided Design (CAD) profiles via a sequence of simple geometric constructions including curve offsetting, rotations and intersections. These sequences start with geometry provided by a designer and build up the points and curves of the final profile step by step. We demonstrate that adding construction steps between the designer's input geometry and the final profile improves generation quality in a similar way to the introduction of a chain of thought in language models. Similar to the constraints in a parametric CAD model, the construction sequences reduce the degrees of freedom in the modeled shape to a small set of parameter values which can be adjusted by the designer, allowing parametric editing with the constructed geometry evaluated to floating point precision. In addition we show that applying reinforcement learning to the construction sequences gives further improvements over a wide range of metrics, including some which were not explicitly optimized.]]></description>

Pre-trained language models (LMs) have, over the last few years, grown substantially in both societal adoption and training costs. This rapid growth in size has constrained progress in understanding and mitigating their biases. Since re-training LMs is prohibitively expensive, most debiasing work has focused on post-hoc or masking-based strategies, which often fail to address the underlying causes of bias. In this work, we seek to democratise pre-model debiasing research by using low-cost proxy models. Specifically, we investigate BabyLMs, compact BERT-like models trained on small and mutable corpora that can approximate bias acquisition and learning dynamics of larger models. We show that BabyLMs display closely aligned patterns of intrinsic bias formation and performance development compared to standard BERT models, despite their drastically reduced size. Furthermore, correlations between BabyLMs and BERT hold across multiple intra-model and post-model debiasing methods. Leveraging these similarities, we conduct pre-model debiasing experiments with BabyLMs, replicating prior findings and presenting new insights regarding the influence of gender imbalance and toxicity on bias formation. Our results demonstrate that BabyLMs can serve as an effective sandbox for large-scale LMs, reducing pre-training costs from over 500 GPU-hours to under 30 GPU-hours. This provides a way to democratise pre-model debiasing research and enables faster, more accessible exploration of methods for building fairer LMs.]]></description>

Osteosarcoma (OS) is an aggressive primary bone malignancy. Accurate histopathological assessment of viable versus non-viable tumor regions after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is critical for prognosis and treatment planning, yet manual evaluation remains labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to inter-observer variability. Recent advances in digital pathology have enabled automated necrosis quantification. Evaluating on test data, independently sampled on patient-level, revealed that the deep learning model performance dropped significantly from the tile-level generalization ability reported in previous studies. First, this work proposes the use of radiomic features as additional input in model training. We show that, despite that they are derived from the images, such a multimodal input effectively improved the classification performance, in addition to its added benefits in interpretability. Second, this work proposes to optimize two binary classification tasks with hierarchical classes (i.e. tumor-vs-non-tumor and viable-vs-non-viable), as opposed to the alternative ``flat'' three-class classification task (i.e. non-tumor, non-viable tumor, viable tumor), thereby enabling a hierarchical loss. We show that such a hierarchical loss, with trainable weightings between the two tasks, the per-class performance can be improved significantly. Using the TCIA OS Tumor Assessment dataset, we experimentally demonstrate the benefits from each of the proposed new approaches and their combination, setting a what we consider new state-of-the-art performance on this open dataset for this application.

We introduce a voice-agentic framework that learns one critical omni-understanding skill: knowing when to trust itself versus when to consult external audio perception. Our work is motivated by a crucial yet counterintuitive finding: naively fine-tuning an omni-model on both speech recognition and external sound understanding tasks often degrades performance, as the model can be easily misled by noisy hypotheses. To address this, our framework, Speech-Hands, recasts the problem as an explicit self-reflection decision. This learnable reflection primitive proves effective in preventing the model from being derailed by flawed external candidates. We show that this agentic action mechanism generalizes naturally from speech recognition to complex, multiple-choice audio reasoning. Across the OpenASR leaderboard, Speech-Hands consistently outperforms strong baselines by 12.1% WER on seven benchmarks. The model also achieves 77.37% accuracy and high F1 on audio QA decisions, showing robust generalization and reliability across diverse audio question answering datasets. By unifying perception and decision-making, our work offers a practical path toward more reliable and resilient audio intelligence.]]></description>

With advances in artificial intelligence, image processing has gained significant interest. Image super-resolution is a vital technology closely related to real-world applications, as it enhances the quality of existing images. Since enhancing fine details is crucial for the super-resolution task, pixels that contribute to high-frequency information should be emphasized. This paper proposes two methods to enhance high-frequency details in super-resolution images: a Laplacian pyramid-based detail loss and a repeated upscaling and downscaling process. Total loss with our detail loss guides a model by separately generating and controlling super-resolution and detail images. This approach allows the model to focus more effectively on high-frequency components, resulting in improved super-resolution images. Additionally, repeated upscaling and downscaling amplify the effectiveness of the detail loss by extracting diverse information from multiple low-resolution features. We conduct two types of experiments. First, we design a CNN-based model incorporating our methods. This model achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing all currently available CNN-based and even some attention-based models. Second, we apply our methods to existing attention-based models on a small scale. In all our experiments, attention-based models adding our detail loss show improvements compared to the originals. These results demonstrate our approaches effectively enhance super-resolution images across different model structures.]]></description>

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge. Recently, some works have incorporated iterative knowledge accumulation processes into RAG models to progressively accumulate and refine query-related knowledge, thereby constructing more comprehensive knowledge representations. However, these iterative processes often lack a coherent organizational structure, which limits the construction of more comprehensive and cohesive knowledge representations. To address this, we propose PAGER, a page-driven autonomous knowledge representation framework for RAG. PAGER first prompts an LLM to construct a structured cognitive outline for a given question, which consists of multiple slots representing a distinct knowledge aspect. Then, PAGER iteratively retrieves and refines relevant documents to populate each slot, ultimately constructing a coherent page that serves as contextual input for guiding answer generation. Experiments on multiple knowledge-intensive benchmarks and backbone models show that PAGER consistently outperforms all RAG baselines. Further analyses demonstrate that PAGER constructs higher-quality and information-dense knowledge representations, better mitigates knowledge conflicts, and enables LLMs to leverage external knowledge more effectively. All code is available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/PAGER.]]></description>

This paper introduces ACS2HER, a novel integration of the Anticipatory Classifier System (ACS2) with the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) mechanism. While ACS2 is highly effective at building cognitive maps through latent learning, its performance often stagnates in environments characterized by sparse rewards. We propose a specific architectural variant that triggers hindsight learning when the agent fails to reach its primary goal, re-labeling visited states as virtual goals to densify the learning signal. The proposed model was evaluated on two benchmarks: the deterministic \texttt{Maze 6} and the stochastic \texttt{FrozenLake}. The results demonstrate that ACS2HER significantly accelerates knowledge acquisition and environmental mastery compared to the standard ACS2. However, this efficiency gain is accompanied by increased computational overhead and a substantial expansion in classifier numerosity. This work provides the first analysis of combining anticipatory mechanisms with retrospective goal-relabeling in Learning Classifier Systems.]]></description>

Large language models can be continually pre-trained or fine-tuned to improve performance in specific domains, languages, or skills, but this specialization often degrades other capabilities and may cause catastrophic forgetting. We investigate how abilities are distributed within LLM parameters by analyzing module activations under domain- and language-specific inputs for closely related models. Across layers and modules, we find that ability-related activations are highly concentrated in a small set of channels (typically <5\%), and these channels are largely disentangled with good sufficiency and stability. Building on these observations, we propose ACT (Activation-Guided Channel-wise Ability Transfer), which localizes ability-relevant channels via activation differences and selectively transfers only the corresponding parameters, followed by lightweight fine-tuning for compatibility. Experiments on multilingual mathematical and scientific reasoning show that ACT can recover forgotten abilities while preserving retained skills. It can also merge multiple specialized models to integrate several abilities into a single model with minimal interference. Our code and data will be publicly released.]]></description>

Graph Transformers (GTs) are increasingly applied to social network analysis, yet their deployment is often constrained by fairness concerns. This issue is particularly critical in incomplete social networks, where sensitive attributes are frequently missing due to privacy and ethical restrictions. Existing solutions commonly generate these incomplete attributes, which may introduce additional biases and further compromise user privacy. To address this challenge, FairGE (Fair Graph Encoding) is introduced as a fairness-aware framework for GTs in incomplete social networks. Instead of generating sensitive attributes, FairGE encodes fairness directly through spectral graph theory. By leveraging the principal eigenvector to represent structural information and padding incomplete sensitive attributes with zeros to maintain independence, FairGE ensures fairness without data reconstruction. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the method suppresses the influence of non-principal spectral components, thereby enhancing fairness. Extensive experiments on seven real-world social network datasets confirm that FairGE achieves at least a 16% improvement in both statistical parity and equality of opportunity compared with state-of-the-art baselines. The source code is shown in https://github.com/LuoRenqiang/FairGE.]]></description>

The recent surge in open-source Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) frameworks, such as LLaVA, provides a convenient kickoff for artificial intelligence developers and researchers. However, most of the MLLM frameworks take vision as the main input modality, and provide limited in-depth support for the modality of speech, audio, and music. This situation hinders the development of audio-language models, and forces researchers to spend a lot of effort on code writing and hyperparameter tuning. We present SLAM-LLM, an open-source deep learning framework designed to train customized MLLMs, focused on speech, language, audio, and music processing. SLAM-LLM provides a modular configuration of different encoders, projectors, LLMs, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning plugins. SLAM-LLM also includes detailed training and inference recipes for mainstream tasks, along with high-performance checkpoints like LLM-based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Automated Audio Captioning (AAC), and Music Captioning (MC). Some of these recipes have already reached or are nearing state-of-the-art performance, and some relevant techniques have also been accepted by academic papers. We hope SLAM-LLM will accelerate iteration, development, data engineering, and model training for researchers. We are committed to continually pushing forward audio-based MLLMs through this open-source framework, and call on the community to contribute to the LLM-based speech, audio and music processing.]]></description>

Current large language model agents predominantly operate under a reactive paradigm, responding only to immediate user queries within short-term sessions. This limitation hinders their ability to maintain long-term user's intents and dynamically adapt to evolving external environments. In this paper, we propose a novel interaction paradigm for proactive Task-oriented Agents capable of bridging the gap between relatively static user's needs and a dynamic environment. We formalize proactivity through two key capabilities, (i) Intent-Conditioned Monitoring: The agent autonomously formulates trigger conditions based on dialog history; (ii) Event-Triggered Follow-up: The agent actively engages the user upon detecting useful environmental updates. We introduce a high-quality data synthesis pipeline to construct complex, multi-turn dialog data in a dynamic environment. Furthermore, we attempt to address the lack of evaluation criteria of task-oriented interaction in a dynamic environment by proposing a new benchmark, namely ChronosBench. We evaluated some leading close-source and open-source models at present and revealed their flaws in long-term task-oriented interaction. Furthermore, our fine-tuned model trained using synthetic data for supervised learning achieves a task completion rate of 85.19% for complex tasks including shifts in user intent, outperforming other models under test. And the result validated the effectiveness of our data-driven strategy.]]></description>

In this paper, I discuss two logics for weighted finite structures: first-order logic with summation (FO(SUM)) and its recursive extension IFP(SUM). These logics originate from foundational work by Grädel, Gurevich, and Meer in the 1990s. In recent joint work with Standke, Steegmans, and Van den Bussche, we have investigated these logics as query languages for machine learning models, specifically neural networks, which are naturally represented as weighted graphs. I present illustrative examples of queries to neural networks that can be expressed in these logics and discuss fundamental results on their expressiveness and computational complexity.]]></description>

Do Large Language Models (LLMs) genuinely grasp the compositional semantics of events, or do they rely on surface-level probabilistic heuristics? We investigate the Imperfective Paradox, a logical phenomenon where the past progressive aspect entails event realization for activities (e.g., running $\to$ ran) but not for accomplishments (e.g., building $\nrightarrow$ built). We introduce ImperfectiveNLI, a diagnostic dataset designed to probe this distinction across diverse semantic classes. Evaluating state-of-the-art open-weight models, we uncover a pervasive Teleological Bias: models systematically hallucinate completion for goal-oriented events, often overriding explicit textual negation. Representational analyses show that while internal embeddings often distinguish process from result, inference decisions are dominated by strong priors about goal attainment. We further find that prompting-based interventions reduce hallucinated completions but also increase incorrect rejections of valid entailments. Our findings suggest that current LLMs lack structural aspectual awareness, operating as predictive narrative engines rather than faithful logical reasoners.]]></description>

The scarcity of annotated datasets for clinical information extraction in non-English languages hinders the evaluation of large language model (LLM)-based methods developed primarily in English. In this study, we present the first comprehensive bilingual evaluation of LLMs for the clinical Relation Extraction (RE) task in both English and Turkish. To facilitate this evaluation, we introduce the first English-Turkish parallel clinical RE dataset, derived and carefully curated from the 2010 i2b2/VA relation classification corpus. We systematically assess a diverse set of prompting strategies, including multiple in-context learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches, and compare their performance to fine-tuned baselines such as PURE. Furthermore, we propose Relation-Aware Retrieval (RAR), a novel in-context example selection method based on contrastive learning, that is specifically designed to capture both sentence-level and relation-level semantics. Our results show that prompting-based LLM approaches consistently outperform traditional fine-tuned models. Moreover, evaluations for English performed better than their Turkish counterparts across all evaluated LLMs and prompting techniques. Among ICL methods, RAR achieves the highest performance, with Gemini 1.5 Flash reaching a micro-F1 score of 0.906 in English and 0.888 in Turkish. Performance further improves to 0.918 F1 in English when RAR is combined with a structured reasoning prompt using the DeepSeek-V3 model. These findings highlight the importance of high-quality demonstration retrieval and underscore the potential of advanced retrieval and prompting techniques to bridge resource gaps in clinical natural language processing.]]></description>

Common ground plays a critical role in situated spoken dialogues, where interlocutors must establish and maintain shared references to entities, events, and relations to sustain coherent interaction. For dialog systems, the ability to correctly ground conversational content in order to refer back to it later is particularly important. Prior studies have demonstrated that LLMs are capable of performing grounding acts such as requesting clarification or producing acknowledgments, yet relatively little work has investigated how common ground can be explicitly represented and stored for later use. Without such mechanisms, it remains unclear whether acknowledgment or clarification behaviors truly reflect a grounded understanding. In this work, we evaluate a model's ability to establish and exploit common ground through relational references to entities within the shared context in a situational dialogue. We test multiple methods for representing common ground in situated dialogues and further propose approaches to improve both the establishment of common ground and its subsequent use in the conversation.]]></description>

Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is crucial for advancing large-scale reasoning models. However, existing parameter-efficient methods, such as PiSSA and MiLoRA, are designed for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and do not account for the distinct optimization dynamics and geometric structures of RLVR. Applying these methods directly leads to spectral collapse and optimization instability, which severely limit model performance. Meanwhile, alternative approaches that leverage update sparsity encounter significant efficiency bottlenecks on modern hardware due to unstructured computations. To address these challenges, we propose GeoRA (Geometry-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation), which exploits the anisotropic and compressible nature of RL update subspaces. GeoRA initializes adapters by extracting principal directions via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) within a geometrically constrained subspace while freezing the residual components. This method preserves the pre-trained geometric structure and enables efficient GPU computation through dense operators. Experiments on Qwen and Llama demonstrate that GeoRA mitigates optimization bottlenecks caused by geometric misalignment. It consistently outperforms established low-rank baselines on key mathematical benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Moreover, GeoRA shows superior generalization and resilience to catastrophic forgetting in out-of-domain tasks.]]></description>

When some resources are to be distributed among a set of agents following egalitarian social welfare, the goal is to maximize the utility of the agent whose utility turns out to be minimal. In this context, agents can have an incentive to lie about their actual preferences, so that more valuable resources are assigned to them. In this paper we analyze this situation, and we present a practical study where genetic algorithms are used to assess the benefits of lying under different situations.]]></description>

Lane-free traffic environments allow vehicles to better harness the lateral capacity of the road without being restricted to lane-keeping, thereby increasing the traffic flow rates. As such, we have a distinct and more challenging setting for autonomous driving. In this work, we consider a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning approach for single-agent autonomous driving in lane-free traffic, where the associated Markov Decision Process we formulate is influenced from existing approaches tied to reinforcement learning frameworks. In addition, MCTS is equipped with a pre-trained neural network (NN) that guides the selection phase. This procedure incorporates the predictive capabilities of NNs for a more informed tree search process under computational constraints. In our experimental evaluation, we consider metrics that address both safety (through collision rates) and efficacy (through measured speed). Then, we examine: (a) the influence of isotropic state information for vehicles in a lane-free environment, resulting in nudging behaviour--vehicles' policy reacts due to the presence of faster tailing ones, (b) the acceleration of performance for the NN-guided variant of MCTS, and (c) the trade-off between computational resources and solution quality.]]></description>

We propose Spectral Complex Autoencoder Pruning (SCAP), a reconstruction-based criterion that measures functional redundancy at the level of individual output channels. For each convolutional layer, we construct a complex interaction field by pairing the full multi-channel input activation as the real part with a single output-channel activation (spatially aligned and broadcast across input channels) as the imaginary part. We transform this complex field to the frequency domain and train a low-capacity autoencoder to reconstruct normalized spectra. Channels whose spectra are reconstructed with high fidelity are interpreted as lying close to a low-dimensional manifold captured by the autoencoder and are therefore more compressible; conversely, channels with low fidelity are retained as they encode information that cannot be compactly represented by the learned manifold. This yields an importance score (optionally fused with the filter L1 norm) that supports simple threshold-based pruning and produces a structurally consistent pruned network. On VGG16 trained on CIFAR-10, at a fixed threshold of 0.6, we obtain 90.11% FLOP reduction and 96.30% parameter reduction with an absolute Top-1 accuracy drop of 1.67% from a 93.44% baseline after fine-tuning, demonstrating that spectral reconstruction fidelity of complex interaction fields is an effective proxy for channel-level redundancy under aggressive compression.]]></description>

Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have improved image recognition and reasoning, but video-related tasks remain challenging due to memory constraints from dense frame processing. Existing Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) methodologies rely on sparse frame sampling, risking potential information loss, especially in lengthy videos. We propose SMORE (See MORE, store less), a framework that enhances memory efficiency while maintaining high information resolution. SMORE (1) uses query-guided captions to encode semantics aligned with user intent, (2) applies query-aware importance modulation to highlight relevant segments, and (3) adaptively compresses frames to preserve key content while reducing redundancy. This enables efficient video understanding without exceeding memory budgets. Experimental validation reveals that SMORE achieves state-of-the-art performance on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and ActivityNet-Captions benchmarks.]]></description>

This work proposes a contextualised detection framework for implicitly hateful speech, implemented as a multi-agent system comprising a central Moderator Agent and dynamically constructed Community Agents representing specific demographic groups. Our approach explicitly integrates socio-cultural context from publicly available knowledge sources, enabling identity-aware moderation that surpasses state-of-the-art prompting methods (zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting) and alternative approaches on a challenging ToxiGen dataset. We enhance the technical rigour of performance evaluation by incorporating balanced accuracy as a central metric of classification fairness that accounts for the trade-off between true positive and true negative rates. We demonstrate that our community-driven consultative framework significantly improves both classification accuracy and fairness across all target groups.]]></description>

The widespread deployment of large-scale, compute-intensive applications such as high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, and big data is leading to convergence between cloud and high-performance computing infrastructures. Cloud providers are increasingly integrating high-performance computing capabilities in their infrastructures, such as hardware accelerators and high-speed interconnects, while researchers in the high-performance computing community are starting to explore cloud-native paradigms to improve scalability, elasticity, and resource utilization. In this context, serverless computing emerges as a promising execution model to efficiently handle highly dynamic, parallel, and distributed workloads. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic literature review of 122 research articles published between 2018 and early 2025, exploring the use of the serverless paradigm to develop, deploy, and orchestrate compute-intensive applications across cloud, high-performance computing, and hybrid environments. From these, a taxonomy comprising eight primary research directions and nine targeted use case domains is proposed, alongside an analysis of recent publication trends and collaboration networks among authors, highlighting the growing interest and interconnections within this emerging research field. Overall, this work aims to offer a valuable foundation for both new researchers and experienced practitioners, guiding the development of next-generation serverless solutions for parallel compute-intensive applications.]]></description>

With the rise of large-scale foundation models, efficiently adapting them to downstream tasks remains a central challenge. Linear probing, which freezes the backbone and trains a lightweight head, is computationally efficient but often restricted to last-layer representations. We show that task-relevant information is distributed across the network hierarchy rather than solely encoded in any of the last layers. To leverage this distribution of information, we apply an attentive probing mechanism that dynamically fuses representations from all layers of a Vision Transformer. This mechanism learns to identify the most relevant layers for a target task and combines low-level structural cues with high-level semantic abstractions. Across 20 diverse datasets and multiple pretrained foundation models, our method achieves consistent, substantial gains over standard linear probes. Attention heatmaps further reveal that tasks different from the pre-training domain benefit most from intermediate representations. Overall, our findings underscore the value of intermediate layer information and demonstrate a principled, task aware approach for unlocking their potential in probing-based adaptation.]]></description>

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in clinical diagnostics, yet it remains hindered by long acquisition times and motion artifacts. Multi-contrast MRI reconstruction has emerged as a promising direction by leveraging complementary information from fully-sampled reference scans. However, existing approaches suffer from three major limitations: (1) superficial reference fusion strategies, such as simple concatenation, (2) insufficient utilization of the complementary information provided by the reference contrast, and (3) fixed under-sampling patterns. We propose an efficient and interpretable frequency error-guided reconstruction framework to tackle these issues. We first employ a conditional diffusion model to learn a Frequency Error Prior (FEP), which is then incorporated into a unified framework for jointly optimizing both the under-sampling pattern and the reconstruction network. The proposed reconstruction model employs a model-driven deep unfolding framework that jointly exploits frequency- and image-domain information. In addition, a spatial alignment module and a reference feature decomposition strategy are incorporated to improve reconstruction quality and bridge model-based optimization with data-driven learning for improved physical interpretability. Comprehensive validation across multiple imaging modalities, acceleration rates (4-30x), and sampling schemes demonstrates consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

Language models perform well on grammatical agreement, but it is unclear whether this reflects rule-based generalization or memorization. We study this question for German definite singular articles, whose forms depend on gender and case. Using GRADIEND, a gradient-based interpretability method, we learn parameter update directions for gender-case specific article transitions. We find that updates learned for a specific gender-case article transition frequently affect unrelated gender-case settings, with substantial overlap among the most affected neurons across settings. These results argue against a strictly rule-based encoding of German definite articles, indicating that models at least partly rely on memorized associations rather than abstract grammatical rules.]]></description>

On-device recommendation is critical for a number of real-world applications, especially in scenarios that have agreements on execution latency, user privacy, and robust functionality when internet connectivity is unstable or even impossible. While large language models (LLMs) can now provide exceptional capabilities that model user behavior for sequential recommendation tasks, their substantial memory footprint and computational overhead make the deployment on resource-constrained devices a high risk proposition. In this paper, we propose OD-LLM, the first task-adaptive compression framework explicitly designed to provide efficient and accurate on-device deployment of LLMs for sequential recommendation tasks. OD-LLM uniquely integrates two complementary compression strategies: a low-rank structural compression algorithm which uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to significantly reduce parameter redundancy in the model, and a novel tokenization normalization technique that better complements the low-rank decomposition process being used. Additionally, to minimize any potential performance degradation when using higher compression ratios, a novel progressive alignment algorithm is used to iteratively refine the parameters required layerwise in the target model. Empirical evaluations conducted on sequential recommendation benchmarks show that OD-LLM exhibits no loss in effectiveness when compared to the original recommendation model, when the deployed model size is halved. These promising results demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of OD-LLM, making this novel solution a practical alternative for real-time, on-device solutions wishing to replace expensive, remotely executed LLMs.]]></description>

Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed learning across multiple clients without sharing raw data. When statistical heterogeneity across clients is severe, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) can improve performance by grouping similar clients and training cluster-wise models. However, most CFL approaches rely on multiple communication rounds for cluster estimation and model updates, which limits their practicality under tight constraints on communication rounds. We propose Data Collaboration-based Clustered Federated Learning (DC-CFL), a single-round framework that completes both client clustering and cluster-wise learning, using only the information shared in DC analysis. DC-CFL quantifies inter-client similarity via total variation distance between label distributions, estimates clusters using hierarchical clustering, and performs cluster-wise learning via DC analysis. Experiments on multiple open datasets under representative non-IID conditions show that DC-CFL achieves accuracy comparable to multi-round baselines while requiring only one communication round. These results indicate that DC-CFL is a practical alternative for collaborative AI model development when multiple communication rounds are impractical.]]></description>

In the information and communications technology (ICT) industry, training a domain-specific large language model (LLM) or constructing a retrieval-augmented generation system requires a substantial amount of high-value domain knowledge. However, the knowledge is not only hidden in the textual modality but also in the image modality. Traditional methods can parse text from domain documents but dont have image captioning ability. Multi-modal LLM (MLLM) can understand images, but they do not have sufficient domain knowledge. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multi-stage progressive training strategy to train a Domain-specific Image Captioning Model (DICModel) in ICT, and constructs a standard evaluation system to validate the performance of DICModel. Specifically, this work first synthesizes about 7K image-text pairs by combining the Mermaid tool and LLMs, which are used for the first-stage supervised-fine-tuning (SFT) of DICModel. Then, ICT-domain experts manually annotate about 2K image-text pairs for the second-stage SFT of DICModel. Finally, experts and LLMs jointly synthesize about 1.5K visual question answering data for the instruction-based SFT. Experimental results indicate that our DICModel with only 7B parameters performs better than other state-of-the-art models with 32B parameters. Compared to the SOTA models with 7B and 32B parameters, our DICModel increases the BLEU metric by approximately 56.8% and 20.8%, respectively. On the objective questions constructed by ICT domain experts, our DICModel outperforms Qwen2.5-VL 32B by 1% in terms of accuracy rate. In summary, this work can efficiently and accurately extract the logical text from images, which is expected to promote the development of multimodal models in the ICT domain.]]></description>

We present a novel framework for solving Dynamic Job Shop Scheduling Problems under uncertainty, addressing the challenges introduced by stochastic job arrivals and unexpected machine breakdowns. Our approach follows a model-based paradigm, using Coloured Timed Petri Nets to represent the scheduling environment, and Maskable Proximal Policy Optimization to enable dynamic decision-making while restricting the agent to feasible actions at each decision point. To simulate realistic industrial conditions, dynamic job arrivals are modeled using a Gamma distribution, which captures complex temporal patterns such as bursts, clustering, and fluctuating workloads. Machine failures are modeled using a Weibull distribution to represent age-dependent degradation and wear-out dynamics. These stochastic models enable the framework to reflect real-world manufacturing scenarios better. In addition, we study two action-masking strategies: a non-gradient approach that overrides the probabilities of invalid actions, and a gradient-based approach that assigns negative gradients to invalid actions within the policy network. We conduct extensive experiments on dynamic JSSP benchmarks, demonstrating that our method consistently outperforms traditional heuristic and rule-based approaches in terms of makespan minimization. The results highlight the strength of combining interpretable Petri-net-based models with adaptive reinforcement learning policies, yielding a resilient, scalable, and explainable framework for real-time scheduling in dynamic and uncertain manufacturing environments.]]></description>

The IEC 61850 Generic Object-Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) protocol plays a critical role in real-time protection and automation of digital substations, yet its lack of native security mechanisms can expose power systems to sophisticated cyberattacks. Traditional rule-based and supervised intrusion detection techniques struggle to detect protocol-compliant and zero-day attacks under significant class imbalance and limited availability of labeled data. This paper proposes an explainable, unsupervised multi-view anomaly detection framework for IEC 61850 GOOSE networks that explicitly separates semantic integrity and temporal availability. The approach employs asymmetric autoencoders trained only on real operational GOOSE traffic to learn distinct latent representations of sequence-based protocol semantics and timing-related transmission dynamics in normal traffic. Anomaly detection is implemented using reconstruction errors mixed with statistically grounded thresholds, enabling robust detection without specified attack types. Feature-level reconstruction analysis provides intrinsic explainability by directly linking detection outcomes to IEC 61850 protocol characteristics. The proposed framework is evaluated using real substation traffic for training and a public dataset containing normal traffic and message suppression, data manipulation, and denial-of-service attacks for testing. Experimental results show attack detection rates above 99% with false positives remaining below 5% of total traffic, demonstrating strong generalization across environments and effective operation under extreme class imbalance and interpretable anomaly attribution.]]></description>

Collaborative Filtering (CF) remains the cornerstone of modern recommender systems, with dense embedding--based methods dominating current practice. However, these approaches suffer from a critical limitation: our theoretical analysis reveals a fundamental signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ceiling when modeling unpopular items, where parameter-based dense models experience diminishing SNR under severe data sparsity. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SaD (Sparse and Dense), a unified framework that integrates the semantic expressiveness of dense embeddings with the structural reliability of sparse interaction patterns. We theoretically show that aligning these dual views yields a strictly superior global SNR. Concretely, SaD introduces a lightweight bidirectional alignment mechanism: the dense view enriches the sparse view by injecting semantic correlations, while the sparse view regularizes the dense model through explicit structural signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under this dual-view alignment, even a simple matrix factorization--style dense model can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, SaD is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of existing recommender models, highlighting the enduring power of collaborative filtering when leveraged from dual perspectives. Further evaluations on real-world benchmarks show that SaD consistently outperforms strong baselines, ranking first on the BarsMatch leaderboard. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/harris26-G/SaD.]]></description>

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous crystalline materials with broad applications such as carbon capture and drug delivery, yet accurately predicting their 3D structures remains a significant challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating crystals, their application to MOFs is hindered by MOFs' high atomic complexity. Inspired by the success of block-wise paradigms in deep generative models, we pioneer the use of LLMs in this domain by introducing MOF-LLM, the first LLM framework specifically adapted for block-level MOF structure prediction. To effectively harness LLMs for this modular assembly task, our training paradigm integrates spatial-aware continual pre-training (CPT), structural supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and matching-driven reinforcement learning (RL). By incorporating explicit spatial priors and optimizing structural stability via Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), our approach substantially enhances the spatial reasoning capability of a Qwen-3 8B model for accurate MOF structure prediction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MOF-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art denoising-based and LLM-based methods while exhibiting superior sampling efficiency.]]></description>

Cluster workload allocation often requires complex configurations, creating a usability gap. This paper introduces a semantic, intent-driven scheduling paradigm for cluster systems using Natural Language Processing. The system employs a Large Language Model (LLM) integrated via a Kubernetes scheduler extender to interpret natural language allocation hint annotations for soft affinity preferences. A prototype featuring a cluster state cache and an intent analyzer (using AWS Bedrock) was developed. Empirical evaluation demonstrated high LLM parsing accuracy (>95% Subset Accuracy on an evaluation ground-truth dataset) for top-tier models like Amazon Nova Pro/Premier and Mistral Pixtral Large, significantly outperforming a baseline engine. Scheduling quality tests across six scenarios showed the prototype achieved superior or equivalent placement compared to standard Kubernetes configurations, particularly excelling in complex and quantitative scenarios and handling conflicting soft preferences. The results validate using LLMs for accessible scheduling but highlight limitations like synchronous LLM latency, suggesting asynchronous processing for production readiness. This work confirms the viability of semantic soft affinity for simplifying workload orchestration.]]></description>

Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have advanced automated multi-step reasoning, but their ability to generate complex Chain-of-Thought (CoT) trajectories introduces severe privacy risks, as sensitive information may be deeply embedded throughout the reasoning process. Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) unlearning approaches that typically focus on modifying only final answers are insufficient for LRMs, as they fail to remove sensitive content from intermediate steps, leading to persistent privacy leakage and degraded security. To address these challenges, we propose Sensitive Trajectory Regulation (STaR), a parameter-free, inference-time unlearning framework that achieves robust privacy protection throughout the reasoning process. Specifically, we first identify sensitive content via semantic-aware detection. Then, we inject global safety constraints through secure prompt prefix. Next, we perform trajectory-aware suppression to dynamically block sensitive content across the entire reasoning chain. Finally, we apply token-level adaptive filtering to prevent both exact and paraphrased sensitive tokens during generation. Furthermore, to overcome the inadequacies of existing evaluation protocols, we introduce two metrics: Multi-Decoding Consistency Assessment (MCS), which measures the consistency of unlearning across diverse decoding strategies, and Multi-Granularity Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Evaluation, which quantifies privacy protection at both answer and reasoning-chain levels. Experiments on the R-TOFU benchmark demonstrate that STaR achieves comprehensive and stable unlearning with minimal utility loss, setting a new standard for privacy-preserving reasoning in LRMs.]]></description>

Recent studies in medical question answering (Medical QA) have actively explored the integration of large language models (LLMs) with biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) to improve factual accuracy. However, most existing approaches still rely on traversing the entire KG or performing large-scale retrieval, which introduces substantial noise and leads to unstable multi-hop reasoning. We argue that the core challenge lies not in expanding access to knowledge, but in identifying and reasoning over the appropriate subset of evidence for each query. ReGraM is a region-first knowledge graph reasoning framework that addresses this challenge by constructing a query-aligned subgraph and performing stepwise reasoning constrained to this localized region under multiple evidence aware modes. By focusing inference on only the most relevant portion of the KG, ReGraM departs from the assumption that all relations are equally useful an assumption that rarely holds in domain-specific medical settings. Experiments on seven medical QA benchmarks demonstrate that ReGraM consistently outperforms a strong baseline (KGARevion), achieving an 8.04% absolute accuracy gain on MCQ, a 4.50% gain on SAQ, and a 42.9% reduction in hallucination rate. Ablation and qualitative analyses further show that aligning region construction with hop-wise reasoning is the primary driver of these improvements. Overall, our results highlight region-first KG reasoning as an effective paradigm for improving factual accuracy and consistency in medical QA.]]></description>

Recent advances in DeepResearch-style agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in autonomous information acquisition and synthesize from real-world web environments. However, existing approaches remain fundamentally limited to text modality. Extending autonomous information-seeking agents to multimodal settings introduces critical challenges: the specialization-generalization trade-off that emerges when training models for multimodal tool-use at scale, and the severe scarcity of training data capturing complex, multi-step multimodal search trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose M$^3$Searcher, a modular multimodal information-seeking agent that explicitly decouples information acquisition from answer derivation. M$^3$Searcher is optimized with a retrieval-oriented multi-objective reward that jointly encourages factual accuracy, reasoning soundness, and retrieval fidelity. In addition, we develop MMSearchVQA, a multimodal multi-hop dataset to support retrieval centric RL training. Experimental results demonstrate that M$^3$Searcher outperforms existing approaches, exhibits strong transfer adaptability and effective reasoning in complex multimodal tasks.]]></description>

With the rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), their potential has garnered significant attention in Chinese Classical Studies (CCS). While existing research has primarily focused on text and visual modalities, the audio corpus within this domain remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose the Multi-task Classical Chinese Literary Genre Audio Corpus (MCGA). It encompasses a diverse range of literary genres across six tasks: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT), Speech Emotion Captioning (SEC), Spoken Question Answering (SQA), Speech Understanding (SU), and Speech Reasoning (SR). Through the evaluation of ten MLLMs, our experimental results demonstrate that current models still face substantial challenges when processed on the MCGA test set. Furthermore, we introduce an evaluation metric for SEC and a metric to measure the consistency between the speech and text capabilities of MLLMs. We release MCGA and our code to the public to facilitate the development of MLLMs with more robust multidimensional audio capabilities in CCS.

Recent work on domain-specific reasoning with large language models (LLMs) often relies on training-intensive approaches that require parameter updates. While activation steering has emerged as a parameter efficient alternative, existing methods apply static, manual interventions that fail to adapt to the dynamic nature of complex reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose RISER (Router-based Intervention for Steerable Enhancement of Reasoning), a plug-and-play intervention framework that adaptively steers LLM reasoning in activation space. RISER constructs a library of reusable reasoning vectors and employs a lightweight Router to dynamically compose them for each input. The Router is optimized via reinforcement learning under task-level rewards, activating latent cognitive primitives in an emergent and compositional manner. Across seven diverse benchmarks, RISER yields 3.4-6.5% average zero-shot accuracy improvements over the base model while surpassing CoT-style reasoning with 2-3x higher token efficiency and robust accuracy gains. Further analysis shows that RISER autonomously combines multiple vectors into interpretable, precise control strategies, pointing toward more controllable and efficient LLM reasoning.]]></description>

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a prominent 3D representation for high-fidelity and real-time rendering. Prior work has coupled physics simulation with Gaussians, but predominantly targets soft, deformable materials, leaving brittle fracture largely unresolved. This stems from two key obstacles: the lack of volumetric interiors with coherent textures in GS representation, and the absence of fracture-aware simulation methods for Gaussians. To address these challenges, we introduce GaussianFluent, a unified framework for realistic simulation and rendering of dynamic object states. First, it synthesizes photorealistic interiors by densifying internal Gaussians guided by generative models. Second, it integrates an optimized Continuum Damage Material Point Method (CD-MPM) to enable brittle fracture simulation at remarkably high speed. Our approach handles complex scenarios including mixed-material objects and multi-stage fracture propagation, achieving results infeasible with previous methods. Experiments clearly demonstrate GaussianFluent's capability for photo-realistic, real-time rendering with structurally consistent interiors, highlighting its potential for downstream application, such as VR and Robotics.]]></description>

Effective pandemic control requires timely and coordinated policymaking across administrative regions that are intrinsically interdependent. However, human-driven responses are often fragmented and reactive, with policies formulated in isolation and adjusted only after outbreaks escalate, undermining proactive intervention and global pandemic mitigation. To address this challenge, here we propose a large language model (LLM) multi-agent policymaking framework that supports coordinated and proactive pandemic control across regions. Within our framework, each administrative region is assigned an LLM agent as an AI policymaking assistant. The agent reasons over region-specific epidemiological dynamics while communicating with other agents to account for cross-regional interdependencies. By integrating real-world data, a pandemic evolution simulator, and structured inter-agent communication, our framework enables agents to jointly explore counterfactual intervention scenarios and synthesize coordinated policy decisions through a closed-loop simulation process. We validate the proposed framework using state-level COVID-19 data from the United States between April and December 2020, together with real-world mobility records and observed policy interventions. Compared with real-world pandemic outcomes, our approach reduces cumulative infections and deaths by up to 63.7% and 40.1%, respectively, at the individual state level, and by 39.0% and 27.0%, respectively, when aggregated across states. These results demonstrate that LLM multi-agent systems can enable more effective pandemic control with coordinated policymaking...]]></description>

Whole-brain parcellation from MRI is a critical yet challenging task due to the complexity of subdividing the brain into numerous small, irregular shaped regions. Traditionally, template-registration methods were used, but recent advances have shifted to deep learning for faster workflows. While large models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offer transferable feature representations, they are not tailored for the high precision required in brain parcellation. To address this, we propose BrainSegNet, a novel framework that adapts SAM for accurate whole-brain parcellation into 95 regions. We enhance SAM by integrating U-Net skip connections and specialized modules into its encoder and decoder, enabling fine-grained anatomical precision. Key components include a hybrid encoder combining U-Net skip connections with SAM's transformer blocks, a multi-scale attention decoder with pyramid pooling for varying-sized structures, and a boundary refinement module to sharpen edges. Experimental results on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate that BrainSegNet outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in complex, multi-label parcellation.]]></description>

Delineating wildfire affected areas using satellite imagery remains challenging due to irregular and spatially heterogeneous spectral changes across the electromagnetic spectrum. While recent deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy when high-resolution multispectral data are available, their applicability in operational settings, where a quick delineation of the burn scar shortly after a wildfire incident is required, is limited by the trade-off between spatial resolution and temporal revisit frequency of current satellite systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel deep learning model, namely BAM-MRCD, which employs multi-resolution, multi-source satellite imagery (MODIS and Sentinel-2) for the timely production of detailed burnt area maps with high spatial and temporal resolution. Our model manages to detect even small scale wildfires with high accuracy, surpassing similar change detection models as well as solid baselines. All data and code are available in the GitHub repository: https://github.com/Orion-AI-Lab/BAM-MRCD.]]></description>

Learning under unobservable feedback reliability poses a distinct challenge beyond optimization robustness: a system must decide whether to learn from an experience, not only how to learn stably. We study this setting as Epistemic Identifiability under Unobservable Reliability (EIUR), where each experience has a latent credibility, reliable and unreliable feedback can be locally indistinguishable, and data are generated in a closed loop by the learner's own evolving beliefs and actions. In EIUR, standard robust learning can converge stably yet form high-confidence, systematically wrong beliefs.
  We propose metacognitive regulation as a practical response: a second, introspective control loop that infers experience credibility from endogenous evidence in the learner's internal dynamics. We formalize this as a modular Monitor-Trust-Regulator (MTR) decomposition and instantiate it with self-diagnosis, which maintains a slowly varying experience-trust variable that softly modulates learning updates, without exogenous reliability labels or an explicit corruption model.
  Empirically, in the EIUR regimes studied here, self-diagnosis is associated with improved epistemic identifiability. In reinforcement learning, it enables calibrated skepticism and recovery under systematically corrupted rewards. In supervised learning, it exposes a critical dissociation: performance recovery does not imply epistemic recovery. Accuracy can rebound while internal belief dynamics remain locked-in by early misleading data, a failure detectable only through introspective diagnostics. Together, MTR and self-diagnosis provide an organizing abstraction and a concrete design template for intrinsic reliability assessment in autonomous learning under unobservable reliability.]]></description>

High-quality chain-of-thought has demonstrated strong potential for unlocking the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, current paradigms typically treat the reasoning process as an indivisible sequence, lacking an intrinsic mechanism to quantify step-wise information gain. This granularity gap manifests in two limitations: inference inefficiency from redundant exploration without explicit guidance, and optimization difficulty due to sparse outcome supervision or costly external verifiers. In this work, we propose CoT-Flow, a framework that reconceptualizes discrete reasoning steps as a continuous probabilistic flow, quantifying the contribution of each step toward the ground-truth answer. Built on this formulation, CoT-Flow enables two complementary methodologies: flow-guided decoding, which employs a greedy flow-based decoding strategy to extract information-efficient reasoning paths, and flow-based reinforcement learning, which constructs a verifier-free dense reward function. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that CoT-Flow achieves a superior balance between inference efficiency and reasoning performance.]]></description>

LLM inference latency critically determines user experience and operational costs, directly impacting throughput under SLO constraints. Even brief latency spikes degrade service quality despite acceptable average performance. However, distributed inference environments featuring diverse software frameworks and XPU architectures combined with dynamic workloads make latency analysis challenging. Constrained by intrusive designs that necessitate service restarts or even suspension, and by hardware-bound implementations that fail to adapt to heterogeneous inference environments, existing AI profiling methods are often inadequate for real-time production analysis.
  We present LatencyPrism, the first zero-intrusion multi-platform latency sculpting system. It aims to break down the inference latency across pipeline, proactively alert on inference latency anomalies, and guarantee adherence to SLOs, all without requiring code modifications or service restarts. LatencyPrism has been deployed across thousands of XPUs for over six months. It enables low-overhead real-time monitoring at batch level with alerts triggered in milliseconds. This approach distinguishes between workload-driven latency variations and anomalies indicating underlying issues with an F1-score of 0.98. We also conduct extensive experiments and investigations into root cause analysis to demonstrate LatencyPrism's capability.]]></description>

Recent diffusion-based video generation models can synthesize visually plausible videos, yet they often struggle to satisfy physical constraints. A key reason is that most existing approaches remain single-stage: they entangle high-level physical understanding with low-level visual synthesis, making it hard to generate content that require explicit physical reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose a training-free three-stage pipeline,\textit{PhyRPR}:\textit{Phy\uline{R}eason}--\textit{Phy\uline{P}lan}--\textit{Phy\uline{R}efine}, which decouples physical understanding from visual synthesis. Specifically, \textit{PhyReason} uses a large multimodal model for physical state reasoning and an image generator for keyframe synthesis; \textit{PhyPlan} deterministically synthesizes a controllable coarse motion scaffold; and \textit{PhyRefine} injects this scaffold into diffusion sampling via a latent fusion strategy to refine appearance while preserving the planned dynamics. This staged design enables explicit physical control during generation. Extensive experiments under physics constraints show that our method consistently improves physical plausibility and motion controllability.]]></description>

While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) are standard for LLM alignment, they either rely on costly expert data or discard valuable negative samples, leading to data inefficiency. To address this, we propose Reward Informed Fine-Tuning (RIFT), a simple yet effective framework that utilizes all self-generated samples. Unlike the hard thresholding of RFT, RIFT repurposes negative trajectories, reweighting the loss with scalar rewards to learn from both the positive and negative trajectories from the model outputs. To overcome the training collapse caused by naive reward integration, where direct multiplication yields an unbounded loss, we introduce a stabilized loss formulation that ensures numerical robustness and optimization efficiency. Extensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks across various base models show that RIFT consistently outperforms RFT. Our results demonstrate that RIFT is a robust and data-efficient alternative for alignment using mixed-quality, self-generated data.]]></description>

Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) systems involve distinct physical domains, fluid and solid, governed by different partial differential equations and coupled at a dynamic interface. While learning-based solvers offer a promising alternative to costly numerical simulations, existing methods struggle to capture the heterogeneous dynamics of FSI within a unified framework. This challenge is further exacerbated by inconsistencies in response across domains due to interface coupling and by disparities in learning difficulty across fluid and solid regions, leading to instability during prediction. To address these challenges, we propose the Heterogeneous Graph Attention Solver (HGATSolver). HGATSolver encodes the system as a heterogeneous graph, embedding physical structure directly into the model via distinct node and edge types for fluid, solid, and interface regions. This enables specialized message-passing mechanisms tailored to each physical domain. To stabilize explicit time stepping, we introduce a novel physics-conditioned gating mechanism that serves as a learnable, adaptive relaxation factor. Furthermore, an Inter-domain Gradient-Balancing Loss dynamically balances the optimization objectives across domains based on predictive uncertainty. Extensive experiments on two constructed FSI benchmarks and a public dataset demonstrate that HGATSolver achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing an effective framework for surrogate modeling of coupled multi-physics systems.]]></description>

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for toxicity assessment in online moderation systems, where fairness across demographic groups is essential for equitable treatment. However, LLMs often produce inconsistent toxicity judgements for subtle expressions, particularly those involving implicit hate speech, revealing underlying biases that are difficult to correct through standard training. This raises a key question that existing approaches often overlook: when should corrective mechanisms be invoked to ensure fair and reliable assessments? To address this, we propose FairToT, an inference-time framework that enhances LLM fairness through prompt-guided toxicity assessment. FairToT identifies cases where demographic-related variation is likely to occur and determines when additional assessment should be applied. In addition, we introduce two interpretable fairness indicators that detect such cases and improve inference consistency without modifying model parameters. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that FairToT reduces group-level disparities while maintaining stable and reliable toxicity predictions, demonstrating that inference-time refinement offers an effective and practical approach for fairness improvement in LLM-based toxicity assessment systems.

Autonomous agents such as cars, robots and drones need to precisely localize themselves in diverse environments, including in GPS-denied indoor environments. One approach for precise localization is visual place recognition (VPR), which estimates the place of an image based on previously seen places. State-of-the-art VPR models require high amounts of memory, making them unwieldy for mobile deployment, while more compact models lack robustness and generalization capabilities. This work overcomes these limitations for robotics using a combination of event-based vision sensors and an event-based novel guided variational autoencoder (VAE). The encoder part of our model is based on a spiking neural network model which is compatible with power-efficient low latency neuromorphic hardware. The VAE successfully disentangles the visual features of 16 distinct places in our new indoor VPR dataset with a classification performance comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches while, showing robust performance also under various illumination conditions. When tested with novel visual inputs from unknown scenes, our model can distinguish between these places, which demonstrates a high generalization capability by learning the essential features of location. Our compact and robust guided VAE with generalization capabilities poses a promising model for visual place recognition that can significantly enhance mobile robot navigation in known and unknown indoor environments.]]></description>

Label assignment is a critical component in object detectors, particularly within DETR-style frameworks where the one-to-one matching strategy, despite its end-to-end elegance, suffers from slow convergence due to sparse supervision. While recent works have explored one-to-many assignments to enrich supervisory signals, they often introduce complex, architecture-specific modifications and typically focus on a single auxiliary strategy, lacking a unified and scalable design. In this paper, we first systematically investigate the effects of ``one-to-many'' supervision and reveal a surprising insight that performance gains are driven not by the sheer quantity of supervision, but by the diversity of the assignment strategies employed. This finding suggests that a more elegant, parameter-efficient approach is attainable. Building on this insight, we propose LoRA-DETR, a flexible and lightweight framework that seamlessly integrates diverse assignment strategies into any DETR-style detector. Our method augments the primary network with multiple Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) branches during training, each instantiating a different one-to-many assignment rule. These branches act as auxiliary modules that inject rich, varied supervisory gradients into the main model and are discarded during inference, thus incurring no additional computational cost. This design promotes robust joint optimization while maintaining the architectural simplicity of the original detector. Extensive experiments on different baselines validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our work presents a new paradigm for enhancing detectors, demonstrating that diverse ``one-to-many'' supervision can be integrated to achieve state-of-the-art results without compromising model elegance.]]></description>

Standardized Student Evaluation of Teaching often suffer from low reliability, restricted response options, and response distortion. Existing machine learning methods that mine open-ended comments usually reduce feedback to binary sentiment, which overlooks concrete concerns such as content clarity, feedback timeliness, and instructor demeanor, and provides limited guidance for instructional improvement.We propose TeachPro, a multi-label learning framework that systematically assesses five key teaching dimensions: professional expertise, instructional behavior, pedagogical efficacy, classroom experience, and other performance metrics. We first propose a Dimension-Anchored Evidence Encoder, which integrates three core components: (i) a pre-trained text encoder that transforms qualitative feedback annotations into contextualized embeddings; (ii) a prompt module that represents five teaching dimensions as learnable semantic anchors; and (iii) a cross-attention mechanism that aligns evidence with pedagogical dimensions within a structured semantic space. We then propose a Cross-View Graph Synergy Network to represent student comments. This network comprises two components: (i) a Syntactic Branch that extracts explicit grammatical dependencies from parse trees, and (ii) a Semantic Branch that models latent conceptual relations derived from BERT-based similarity graphs. BiAffine fusion module aligns syntactic and semantic units, while a differential regularizer disentangles embeddings to encourage complementary representations. Finally, a cross-attention mechanism bridges the dimension-anchored evidence with the multi-view comment representations. We also contribute a novel benchmark dataset featuring expert qualitative annotations and multi-label scores. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TeachPro offers superior diagnostic granularity and robustness across diverse evaluation settings.]]></description>

Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful representation for high-quality, real-time 3D scene rendering. While recent works extend Gaussians with learnable textures to enrich visual appearance, existing approaches allocate a fixed square texture per primitive, leading to inefficient memory usage and limited adaptability to scene variability. In this paper, we introduce adaptive anisotropic textured Gaussians (A$^2$TG), a novel representation that generalizes textured Gaussians by equipping each primitive with an anisotropic texture. Our method employs a gradient-guided adaptive rule to jointly determine texture resolution and aspect ratio, enabling non-uniform, detail-aware allocation that aligns with the anisotropic nature of Gaussian splats. This design significantly improves texture efficiency, reducing memory consumption while enhancing image quality. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that A TG consistently outperforms fixed-texture Gaussian Splatting methods, achieving comparable rendering fidelity with substantially lower memory requirements.]]></description>

Knowledge Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) extends the RAG paradigm by incorporating structured knowledge from knowledge graphs, enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform more precise and explainable reasoning. While KG-RAG improves factual accuracy in complex tasks, existing KG-RAG models are often severely overconfident, producing high-confidence predictions even when retrieved sub-graphs are incomplete or unreliable, which raises concerns for deployment in high-stakes domains. To address this issue, we propose Ca2KG, a Causality-aware Calibration framework for KG-RAG. Ca2KG integrates counterfactual prompting, which exposes retrieval-dependent uncertainties in knowledge quality and reasoning reliability, with a panel-based re-scoring mechanism that stabilises predictions across interventions. Extensive experiments on two complex QA datasets demonstrate that Ca2KG consistently improves calibration while maintaining or even enhancing predictive accuracy.]]></description>

Satellite videos provide continuous observations of surface dynamics but pose significant challenges for multi-object tracking (MOT), especially under unstabilized conditions where platform jitter and the weak appearance of tiny objects jointly degrade tracking performance. To address this problem, we propose DeTracker, a joint detection-and-tracking framework tailored for unstabilized satellite videos. DeTracker introduces a Global--Local Motion Decoupling (GLMD) module that explicitly separates satellite platform motion from true object motion through global alignment and local refinement, leading to improved trajectory stability and motion estimation accuracy. In addition, a Temporal Dependency Feature Pyramid (TDFP) module is developed to perform cross-frame temporal feature fusion, enhancing the continuity and discriminability of tiny-object representations. We further construct a new benchmark dataset, SDM-Car-SU, which simulates multi-directional and multi-speed platform motions to enable systematic evaluation of tracking robustness under varying motion perturbations. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real unstabilized satellite videos demonstrate that DeTracker significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 61.1% MOTA on SDM-Car-SU and 47.3% MOTA on real satellite video data.]]></description>

Substation meters play a critical role in monitoring and ensuring the stable operation of power grids, yet their detection of cracks and other physical defects is often hampered by a severe scarcity of annotated samples. To address this few-shot generation challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates Knowledge Embedding and Hypernetwork-Guided Conditional Control into a Stable Diffusion pipeline, enabling realistic and controllable synthesis of defect images from limited data.
  First, we bridge the substantial domain gap between natural-image pre-trained models and industrial equipment by fine-tuning a Stable Diffusion backbone using DreamBooth-style knowledge embedding. This process encodes the unique structural and textural priors of substation meters, ensuring generated images retain authentic meter characteristics.
  Second, we introduce a geometric crack modeling module that parameterizes defect attributes--such as location, length, curvature, and branching pattern--to produce spatially constrained control maps. These maps provide precise, pixel-level guidance during generation.
  Third, we design a lightweight hypernetwork that dynamically modulates the denoising process of the diffusion model in response to the control maps and high-level defect descriptors, achieving a flexible balance between generation fidelity and controllability.
  Extensive experiments on a real-world substation meter dataset demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing augmentation and generation baselines. It reduces Frechet Inception Distance (FID) by 32.7%, increases diversity metrics, and--most importantly--boosts the mAP of a downstream defect detector by 15.3% when trained on augmented data. The framework offers a practical, high-quality data synthesis solution for industrial inspection systems where defect samples are rare.]]></description>

Despite the prevalent assumption of uniform variable importance in long-term time series forecasting models, real world applications often exhibit asymmetric causal relationships and varying data acquisition costs. Specifically, cost-effective exogenous data (e.g., local weather) can unilaterally influence dynamics of endogenous variables, such as lake surface temperature. Exploiting these links enables more effective forecasts when exogenous inputs are readily available. Transformer-based models capture long-range dependencies but incur high computation and suffer from permutation invariance. Patch-based variants improve efficiency yet can miss local temporal patterns. To efficiently exploit informative signals across both the temporal dimension and relevant exogenous variables, this study proposes XLinear, a lightweight time series forecasting model built upon MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLPs). XLinear uses a global token derived from an endogenous variable as a pivotal hub for interacting with exogenous variables, and employs MLPs with sigmoid activation to extract both temporal patterns and variate-wise dependencies. Its prediction head then integrates these signals to forecast the endogenous series. We evaluate XLinear on seven standard benchmarks and five real-world datasets with exogenous inputs. Compared with state-of-the-art models, XLinear delivers superior accuracy and efficiency for both multivariate forecasts and univariate forecasts influenced by exogenous inputs.]]></description>

Reward design remains a significant bottleneck in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world problems. A popular alternative is reward learning, where reward functions are inferred from human feedback rather than manually specified. Recent work has proposed learning reward functions from human feedback in the form of ratings, rather than traditional binary preferences, enabling richer and potentially less cognitively demanding supervision. Building on this paradigm, we introduce a new rating-based RL method, Ranked Return Regression for RL (R4). At its core, R4 employs a novel ranking mean squared error (rMSE) loss, which treats teacher-provided ratings as ordinal targets. Our approach learns from a dataset of trajectory-rating pairs, where each trajectory is labeled with a discrete rating (e.g., "bad," "neutral," "good"). At each training step, we sample a set of trajectories, predict their returns, and rank them using a differentiable sorting operator (soft ranks). We then optimize a mean squared error loss between the resulting soft ranks and the teacher's ratings. Unlike prior rating-based approaches, R4 offers formal guarantees: its solution set is provably minimal and complete under mild assumptions. Empirically, using simulated human feedback, we demonstrate that R4 consistently matches or outperforms existing rating and preference-based RL methods on robotic locomotion benchmarks from OpenAI Gym and the DeepMind Control Suite, while requiring significantly less feedback.]]></description>

The prevailing post-training paradigm for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs)--Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL)--suffers from an intrinsic optimization mismatch: the rigid supervision inherent in SFT induces distributional collapse, thereby exhausting the exploration space necessary for subsequent RL. In this paper, we reformulate SFT within a unified post-training framework and propose Gibbs Initialization with Finite Temperature (GIFT). We characterize standard SFT as a degenerate zero-temperature limit that suppresses base priors. Conversely, GIFT incorporates supervision as a finite-temperature energy potential, establishing a distributional bridge that ensures objective consistency throughout the post-training pipeline. Our experiments demonstrate that GIFT significantly outperforms standard SFT and other competitive baselines when utilized for RL initialization, providing a mathematically principled pathway toward achieving global optimality in post-training. Our code is available at https://github.com/zzy1127/GIFT.]]></description>

Robust local feature representations are essential for spatial intelligence tasks such as robot navigation and augmented reality. Establishing reliable correspondences requires descriptors that provide both high discriminative power and computational efficiency. To address this, we introduce Cross-Layer Independent Deformable Description (CLIDD), a method that achieves superior distinctiveness by sampling directly from independent feature hierarchies. This approach utilizes learnable offsets to capture fine-grained structural details across scales while bypassing the computational burden of unified dense representations. To ensure real-time performance, we implement a hardware-aware kernel fusion strategy that maximizes inference throughput. Furthermore, we develop a scalable framework that integrates lightweight architectures with a training protocol leveraging both metric learning and knowledge distillation. This scheme generates a wide spectrum of model variants optimized for diverse deployment constraints. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves superior matching accuracy and exceptional computational efficiency simultaneously. Specifically, the ultra-compact variant matches the precision of SuperPoint while utilizing only 0.004M parameters, achieving a 99.7% reduction in model size. Furthermore, our high-performance configuration outperforms all current state-of-the-art methods, including high-capacity DINOv2-based frameworks, while exceeding 200 FPS on edge devices. These results demonstrate that CLIDD delivers high-precision local feature matching with minimal computational overhead, providing a robust and scalable solution for real-time spatial intelligence tasks.]]></description>

Person identification in forensic investigations becomes very challenging when common identification means for DNA (i.e., hair strands, soft tissue) are not available. Current methods utilize deep learning methods for face recognition. However, these methods lack effective mechanisms to model cross-domain structural correspondence between two different forensic modalities. In this paper, we introduce a SPOT-Face, a superpixel graph-based framework designed for cross-domain forensic face identification of victims using their skeleton and sketch images. Our unified framework involves constructing a superpixel-based graph from an image and then using different graph neural networks(GNNs) backbones to extract the embeddings of these graphs, while cross-domain correspondence is established through attention-guided optimal transport mechanism. We have evaluated our proposed framework on two publicly available dataset: IIT\_Mandi\_S2F (S2F) and CUFS. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate our proposed framework. The experimental results show significant improvement in identification metrics ( i.e., Recall, mAP) over existing graph-based baselines. Furthermore, our framework demonstrates to be highly effective for matching skulls and sketches to faces in forensic investigations.]]></description>

Infrared object detection focuses on identifying and locating objects in complex environments (\eg, dark, snow, and rain) where visible imaging cameras are disabled by poor illumination. However, due to low contrast and weak edge information in infrared images, it is challenging to extract discriminative object features for robust detection. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel vision-language representation learning paradigm for infrared object detection. An additional textual supervision with rich semantic information is explored to guide the disentanglement of object and non-object features. Specifically, we propose a Semantic Feature Alignment (SFA) module to align the object features with the corresponding text features. Furthermore, we develop an Object Feature Disentanglement (OFD) module that disentangles text-aligned object features and non-object features by minimizing their correlation. Finally, the disentangled object features are entered into the detection head. In this manner, the detection performance can be remarkably enhanced via more discriminative and less noisy features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on two benchmarks: M\textsuperscript{3}FD (83.7\% mAP), FLIR (86.1\% mAP). Our code will be publicly available once the paper is accepted.]]></description>

Marked Temporal Point Processes (MTPPs) arise naturally in medical, social, commercial, and financial domains. However, existing Transformer-based methods mostly inject temporal information only via positional encodings, relying on shared or parametric decay structures, which limits their ability to capture heterogeneous and type-specific temporal effects. Inspired by this observation, we derive a novel attention operator called Hawkes Attention from the multivariate Hawkes process theory for MTPP, using learnable per-type neural kernels to modulate query, key and value projections, thereby replacing the corresponding parts in the traditional attention. Benefited from the design, Hawkes Attention unifies event timing and content interaction, learning both the time-relevant behavior and type-specific excitation patterns from the data. The experimental results show that our method achieves better performance compared to the baselines. In addition to the general MTPP, our attention mechanism can also be easily applied to specific temporal structures, such as time series forecasting.]]></description>

User simulators serve as the critical interactive environment for agent post-training, and an ideal user simulator generalizes across domains and proactively engages in negotiation by challenging or bargaining. However, current methods exhibit two issues. They rely on static and context-unaware profiles, necessitating extensive manual redesign for new scenarios, thus limiting generalizability. Moreover, they neglect human strategic thinking, leading to vulnerability to agent manipulation. To address these issues, we propose UserLM-R1, a novel user language model with reasoning capability. Specifically, we first construct comprehensive user profiles with both static roles and dynamic scenario-specific goals for adaptation to diverse scenarios. Then, we propose a goal-driven decision-making policy to generate high-quality rationales before producing responses, and further refine the reasoning and improve strategic capabilities with supervised fine-tuning and multi-reward reinforcement learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that UserLM-R1 outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on the more challenging adversarial set.]]></description>

Reconstructing natural visual scenes from neural activity is a key challenge in neuroscience and computer vision. We present SpikeVAEDiff, a novel two-stage framework that combines a Very Deep Variational Autoencoder (VDVAE) and the Versatile Diffusion model to generate high-resolution and semantically meaningful image reconstructions from neural spike data. In the first stage, VDVAE produces low-resolution preliminary reconstructions by mapping neural spike signals to latent representations. In the second stage, regression models map neural spike signals to CLIP-Vision and CLIP-Text features, enabling Versatile Diffusion to refine the images via image-to-image generation.
  We evaluate our approach on the Allen Visual Coding-Neuropixels dataset and analyze different brain regions. Our results show that the VISI region exhibits the most prominent activation and plays a key role in reconstruction quality. We present both successful and unsuccessful reconstruction examples, reflecting the challenges of decoding neural activity. Compared with fMRI-based approaches, spike data provides superior temporal and spatial resolution. We further validate the effectiveness of the VDVAE model and conduct ablation studies demonstrating that data from specific brain regions significantly enhances reconstruction performance.]]></description>

Despite significant progress in autoregressive image generation, inference remains slow due to the sequential nature of AR models and the ambiguity of image tokens, even when using speculative decoding. Recent works attempt to address this with relaxed speculative decoding but lack theoretical grounding. In this paper, we establish the theoretical basis of relaxed SD and propose COOL-SD, an annealed relaxation of speculative decoding built on two key insights. The first analyzes the total variation (TV) distance between the target model and relaxed speculative decoding and yields an optimal resampling distribution that minimizes an upper bound of the distance. The second uses perturbation analysis to reveal an annealing behaviour in relaxed speculative decoding, motivating our annealed design. Together, these insights enable COOL-SD to generate images faster with comparable quality, or achieve better quality at similar latency. Experiments validate the effectiveness of COOL-SD, showing consistent improvements over prior methods in speed-quality trade-offs.]]></description>

This paper addresses the problem of affordance grounding from RGBD images of an object, which aims to localize surface regions corresponding to a text query that describes an action on the object. While existing methods predict affordance regions only on visible surfaces, we propose Affostruction, a generative framework that reconstructs complete geometry from partial observations and grounds affordances on the full shape including unobserved regions. We make three core contributions: generative multi-view reconstruction via sparse voxel fusion that extrapolates unseen geometry while maintaining constant token complexity, flow-based affordance grounding that captures inherent ambiguity in affordance distributions, and affordance-driven active view selection that leverages predicted affordances for intelligent viewpoint sampling. Affostruction achieves 19.1 aIoU on affordance grounding (40.4\% improvement) and 32.67 IoU for 3D reconstruction (67.7\% improvement), enabling accurate affordance prediction on complete shapes.]]></description>

White-Light Imaging (WLI) is the standard for endoscopic cancer screening, but Narrow-Band Imaging (NBI) offers superior diagnostic details. A key challenge is transferring knowledge from NBI to enhance WLI-only models, yet existing methods are critically hampered by their reliance on paired NBI-WLI images of the same lesion, a costly and often impractical requirement that leaves vast amounts of clinical data untapped. In this paper, we break this paradigm by introducing PaGKD, a novel Pairing-free Group-level Knowledge Distillation framework that that enables effective cross-modal learning using unpaired WLI and NBI data. Instead of forcing alignment between individual, often semantically mismatched image instances, PaGKD operates at the group level to distill more complete and compatible knowledge across modalities. Central to PaGKD are two complementary modules: (1) Group-level Prototype Distillation (GKD-Pro) distills compact group representations by extracting modality-invariant semantic prototypes via shared lesion-aware queries; (2) Group-level Dense Distillation (GKD-Den) performs dense cross-modal alignment by guiding group-aware attention with activation-derived relation maps. Together, these modules enforce global semantic consistency and local structural coherence without requiring image-level correspondence. Extensive experiments on four clinical datasets demonstrate that PaGKD consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving relative AUC improvements of 3.3%, 1.1%, 2.8%, and 3.2%, respectively, establishing a new direction for cross-modal learning from unpaired data.]]></description>

Recent progress in large language models and multimodal interaction has made it possible to develop AI companions that can have fluent and emotionally expressive conversations. However, many of these systems have problems keeping users satisfied and engaged over long periods. This paper argues that these problems do not come mainly from weak models, but from poor character design and unclear definitions of the user-AI relationship. I present Mikasa, an emotional AI companion inspired by Japanese Oshi culture-specifically its emphasis on long-term, non-exclusive commitment to a stable character-as a case study of character-driven companion design. Mikasa does not work as a general-purpose assistant or a chatbot that changes roles. Instead, Mikasa is designed as a coherent character with a stable personality and a clearly defined relationship as a partner. This relationship does not force exclusivity or obligation. Rather, it works as a reference point that stabilizes interaction norms and reduces the work users must do to keep redefining the relationship. Through an exploratory evaluation, I see that users describe their preferences using surface-level qualities such as conversational naturalness, but they also value relationship control and imaginative engagement in ways they do not state directly. These results suggest that character coherence and relationship definition work as latent structural elements that shape how good the interaction feels, without users recognizing them as main features. The contribution of this work is to show that character design is a functional part of AI companion systems, not just decoration. Mikasa is one example based on a specific cultural context, but the design principles-commitment to a consistent personality and clear relationship definition-can be used for many emotionally grounded AI companions.]]></description>

Purpose: Myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos is a challenging task due to low contrast, noise, and anatomical variability. Traditional deep learning models either process frames independently, ignoring temporal information, or rely on memory-based feature propagation, which accumulates error over time. Methods: We propose Point-Seg, a transformer-based segmentation framework that integrates point tracking as a temporal cue to ensure stable and consistent segmentation of myocardium across frames. Our method leverages a point-tracking module trained on a synthetic echocardiography dataset to track key anatomical landmarks across video sequences. These tracked trajectories provide an explicit motion-aware signal that guides segmentation, reducing drift and eliminating the need for memory-based feature accumulation. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal smoothing loss to further enhance temporal consistency across frames. Results: We evaluate our approach on both public and private echocardiography datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that Point-Seg has statistically similar accuracy in terms of Dice to state-of-the-art segmentation models in high quality echo data, while it achieves better segmentation accuracy in lower quality echo with improved temporal stability. Furthermore, Point-Seg has the key advantage of pixel-level myocardium motion information as opposed to other segmentation methods. Such information is essential in the computation of other downstream tasks such as myocardial strain measurement and regional wall motion abnormality detection. Conclusion: Point-Seg demonstrates that point tracking can serve as an effective temporal cue for consistent video segmentation, offering a reliable and generalizable approach for myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos. The code is available at https://github.com/DeepRCL/PointSeg.]]></description>

We introduce A.X K1, a 519B-parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model trained from scratch. Our design leverages scaling laws to optimize training configurations and vocabulary size under fixed computational budgets. A.X K1 is pre-trained on a corpus of approximately 10T tokens, curated by a multi-stage data processing pipeline. Designed to bridge the gap between reasoning capability and inference efficiency, A.X K1 supports explicitly controllable reasoning to facilitate scalable deployment across diverse real-world scenarios. We propose a simple yet effective Think-Fusion training recipe, enabling user-controlled switching between thinking and non-thinking modes within a single unified model. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that A.X K1 achieves performance competitive with leading open-source models, while establishing a distinctive advantage in Korean-language benchmarks.]]></description>

Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a fundamental post-training strategy to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent. However, traditional SFT often ignores the one-to-many nature of language by forcing alignment with a single reference answer, leading to the model overfitting to non-core expressions. Although our empirical analysis suggests that introducing multiple reference answers can mitigate this issue, the prohibitive data and computational costs necessitate a strategic shift: prioritizing the mitigation of single-reference overfitting over the costly pursuit of answer diversity. To achieve this, we reveal the intrinsic connection between token probability and semantic importance: high-probability tokens carry the core logical framework, while low-probability tokens are mostly replaceable expressions. Based on this insight, we propose ProFit, which selectively masks low-probability tokens to prevent surface-level overfitting. Extensive experiments confirm that ProFit consistently outperforms traditional SFT baselines on general reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.]]></description>

Deploying medical image segmentation models in routine clinical workflows is often constrained by on-premises infrastructure, where computational resources are fixed and cloud-based inference may be restricted by governance and security policies. While high-capacity models achieve strong segmentation accuracy, their computational demands hinder practical deployment and long-term maintainability in hospital environments. We present a deployment-oriented framework that leverages knowledge distillation to translate a high-performing segmentation model into a scalable family of compact student models, without modifying the inference pipeline. The proposed approach preserves architectural compatibility with existing clinical systems while enabling systematic capacity reduction. The framework is evaluated on a multi-site brain MRI dataset comprising 1,104 3D volumes, with independent testing on 101 curated cases, and is further examined on abdominal CT to assess cross-modality generalizability. Under aggressive parameter reduction (94%), the distilled student model preserves nearly all of the teacher's segmentation accuracy (98.7%), while achieving substantial efficiency gains, including up to a 67% reduction in CPU inference latency without additional deployment overhead. These results demonstrate that knowledge distillation provides a practical and reliable pathway for converting research-grade segmentation models into maintainable, deployment-ready components for on-premises clinical workflows in real-world health systems.]]></description>

Large language models and text encoders increasingly power web-based information systems in the social sciences, including digital libraries, data catalogues, and search interfaces used by researchers, policymakers, and civil society. Full fine-tuning is often computationally and energy intensive, which can be prohibitive for smaller institutions and non-profit organizations in the Web4Good ecosystem. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces this cost by updating only a small number of parameters. We show that the standard LoRA update $ΔW = BA^\top$ has geometric drawbacks: gauge freedom, scale ambiguity, and a tendency toward rank collapse. We introduce OrthoGeoLoRA, which enforces an SVD-like form $ΔW = BΣA^\top$ by constraining the low-rank factors to be orthogonal (Stiefel manifold). A geometric reparameterization implements this constraint while remaining compatible with standard optimizers such as Adam and existing fine-tuning pipelines. We also propose a benchmark for hierarchical concept retrieval over the European Language Social Science Thesaurus (ELSST), widely used to organize social science resources in digital repositories. Experiments with a multilingual sentence encoder show that OrthoGeoLoRA outperforms standard LoRA and several strong PEFT variants on ranking metrics under the same low-rank budget, offering a more compute- and parameter-efficient path to adapt foundation models in resource-constrained settings.]]></description>

The rapid expansion of AI research has intensified the Reviewer Gap, threatening the peer-review sustainability and perpetuating a cycle of low-quality evaluations. This position paper critiques existing LLM approaches that automatically generate reviews and argues for a paradigm shift that positions LLMs as tools for assisting and educating human reviewers. We define the core principles of high-quality peer review and propose two complementary systems grounded in these foundations: (i) an LLM-assisted mentoring system that cultivates reviewers' long-term competencies, and (ii) an LLM-assisted feedback system that helps reviewers refine the quality of their reviews. This human-centered approach aims to strengthen reviewer expertise and contribute to building a more sustainable scholarly ecosystem.]]></description>

Large language models (LLMs) face significant deployment challenges due to their massive computational demands. % While pruning offers a promising compression solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: (1) They neglect activation distribution shifts between calibration data and test data, resulting in inaccurate error estimations; (2) They overlook the long-tail distribution characteristics of activations in the attention module. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel pruning method, $D^2Prune$. First, we propose a dual Taylor expansion-based method that jointly models weight and activation perturbations for precise error estimation, leading to precise pruning mask selection and weight updating and facilitating error minimization during pruning. % Second, we propose an attention-aware dynamic update strategy that preserves the long-tail attention pattern by jointly minimizing the KL divergence of attention distributions and the reconstruction error. Extensive experiments show that $D^2Prune$ consistently outperforms SOTA methods across various LLMs (e.g., OPT-125M, LLaMA2/3, and Qwen3). Moreover, the dynamic attention update mechanism also generalizes well to ViT-based vision models like DeiT, achieving superior accuracy on ImageNet-1K.]]></description>

Analysis of learned representations has a blind spot: it focuses on $similarity$, measuring how closely embeddings align with external references, but similarity reveals only what is represented, not whether that structure is robust. We introduce $geometric$ $stability$, a distinct dimension that quantifies how reliably representational geometry holds under perturbation, and present $Shesha$, a framework for measuring it. Across 2,463 configurations in seven domains, we show that stability and similarity are empirically uncorrelated ($ρ\approx 0.01$) and mechanistically distinct: similarity metrics collapse after removing the top principal components, while stability retains sensitivity to fine-grained manifold structure. This distinction yields actionable insights: for safety monitoring, stability acts as a functional geometric canary, detecting structural drift nearly 2$\times$ more sensitively than CKA while filtering out the non-functional noise that triggers false alarms in rigid distance metrics; for controllability, supervised stability predicts linear steerability ($ρ= 0.89$-$0.96$); for model selection, stability dissociates from transferability, revealing a geometric tax that transfer optimization incurs. Beyond machine learning, stability predicts CRISPR perturbation coherence and neural-behavioral coupling. By quantifying $how$ $reliably$ systems maintain structure, geometric stability provides a necessary complement to similarity for auditing representations across biological and computational systems.]]></description>

As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly shape online content, removing targeted information from well-trained LLMs (also known as LLM unlearning) has become critical for web governance. A key challenge lies in sample-wise imbalance within the forget set: different samples exhibit widely varying unlearning difficulty, leading to asynchronous forgetting where some knowledge remains insufficiently erased while others become over-forgotten. To address this, we propose BalDRO, a novel and efficient framework for balanced LLM unlearning. BalDRO formulates unlearning as a min-sup process: an inner step identifies a worst-case data distribution that emphasizes hard-to-unlearn samples, while an outer step updates model parameters under this distribution. We instantiate BalDRO via two efficient variants: BalDRO-G, a discrete GroupDRO-based approximation focusing on high-loss subsets, and BalDRO-DV, a continuous Donsker-Varadhan dual method enabling smooth adaptive weighting within standard training pipelines. Experiments on TOFU and MUSE show that BalDRO significantly improves both forgetting quality and model utility over existing methods, and we release code for reproducibility.]]></description>

In this work, we propose N EIoU YOLOv9, a lightweight detection framework based on a signal aware bounding box regression loss derived from non monotonic gradient focusing and geometric decoupling principles, referred to as N EIoU (Non monotonic Efficient Intersection over Union). The proposed loss reshapes localization gradients by combining non monotonic focusing with decoupled width and height optimization, thereby enhancing weak regression signals for hard samples with low overlap while reducing gradient interference. This design is particularly effective for small and low contrast targets commonly observed in agricultural disease imagery. The proposed N EIoU loss is integrated into a lightweight YOLOv9t architecture and evaluated on a self collected field dataset comprising 5908 rice leaf images across four disease categories and healthy leaves. Experimental results demonstrate consistent performance gains over the standard CIoU loss, achieving a mean Average Precision of 90.3 percent, corresponding to a 4.3 percent improvement over the baseline, with improved localization accuracy under stricter evaluation criteria. For practical validation, the optimized model is deployed on an Android device using TensorFlow Lite with Float16 quantization, achieving an average inference time of 156 milliseconds per frame while maintaining accuracy. These results confirm that the proposed approach effectively balances accuracy, optimization stability, and computational efficiency for edge based agricultural monitoring systems.]]></description>

Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) text-to-image systems are increasingly used to generate architectural imagery, yet their capacity to reproduce accurate images in a historically rule-bound field remains poorly characterized. We evaluated five widely used GenAI image platforms (Adobe Firefly, DALL-E 3, Google Imagen 3, Microsoft Image Generator, and Midjourney) using 30 architectural prompts spanning styles, typologies, and codified elements. Each prompt-generator pair produced four images (n = 600 images total). Two architectural historians independently scored each image for accuracy against predefined criteria, resolving disagreements by consensus. Set-level performance was summarized as zero to four accurate images per four-image set. Image output from Common prompts was 2.7-fold more accurate than from Rare prompts (p < 0.05). Across platforms, overall accuracy was limited (highest accuracy score 52 percent; lowest 32 percent; mean 42 percent). All-correct (4 out of 4) outcomes were similar across platforms. By contrast, all-incorrect (0 out of 4) outcomes varied substantially, with Imagen 3 exhibiting the fewest failures and Microsoft Image Generator exhibiting the highest number of failures. Qualitative review of the image dataset identified recurring patterns including over-embellishment, confusion between medieval styles and their later revivals, and misrepresentation of descriptive prompts (for example, egg-and-dart, banded column, pendentive). These findings support the need for visible labeling of GenAI synthetic content, provenance standards for future training datasets, and cautious educational use of GenAI architectural imagery.]]></description>

Differentially private federated learning (DP-FL) suffers from slow convergence under tight privacy budgets due to the overwhelming noise introduced to preserve privacy. While adaptive optimizers can accelerate convergence, existing second-order methods such as DP-FedNew require O(d^2) memory at each client to maintain local feature covariance matrices, making them impractical for high-dimensional models. We propose DP-FedSOFIM, a server-side second-order optimization framework that leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) as a natural gradient preconditioner while requiring only O(d) memory per client. By employing the Sherman-Morrison formula for efficient matrix inversion, DP-FedSOFIM achieves O(d) computational complexity per round while maintaining the convergence benefits of second-order methods. Our analysis proves that the server-side preconditioning preserves (epsilon, delta)-differential privacy through the post-processing theorem. Empirical evaluation on CIFAR-10 demonstrates that DP-FedSOFIM achieves superior test accuracy compared to first-order baselines across multiple privacy regimes.]]></description>

Building on the probability-domain distillation framework of Sparse-KD, we develop an axiomatic, operator-theoretic framework for multi-teacher ensemble knowledge distillation. Rather than prescribing a specific aggregation formula, we define five core axioms governing valid knowledge aggregation operators, encompassing convexity, positivity, continuity, weight monotonicity, and temperature coherence. We prove the existence and non-uniqueness of operator families satisfying these axioms, establishing that multiple distinct aggregation mechanisms conform to the same foundational principles.
  Within this framework, we establish operator-agnostic guarantees showing that multi-teacher aggregation reduces both stochastic variance and systematic supervisory bias under heterogeneous teachers, while providing Jensen-type bounds, log-loss guarantees, and safety attenuation properties. For aggregation operators linear in teacher weights, we further establish classical ensemble variance-reduction results under standard independence assumptions, with extensions to correlated-error regimes. The framework provides theoretical grounding for multi-teacher distillation from diverse frontier models while admitting multiple valid implementation strategies.]]></description>

We study the Bandit Clustering (BC) problem under the fixed confidence setting, where the objective is to group a collection of data sequences (arms) into clusters through sequential sampling from adaptively selected arms at each time step while ensuring a fixed error probability at the stopping time. We consider a setting where arms in a cluster may have different distributions. Unlike existing results in this setting, which assume Gaussian-distributed arms, we study a broader class of vector-parametric distributions that satisfy mild regularity conditions. Existing asymptotically optimal BC algorithms require solving an optimization problem as part of their sampling rule at each step, which is computationally costly. We propose an Efficient Bandit Clustering algorithm (EBC), which, instead of solving the full optimization problem, takes a single step toward the optimal value at each time step, making it computationally efficient while remaining asymptotically optimal. We also propose a heuristic variant of EBC, called EBC-H, which further simplifies the sampling rule, with arm selection based on quantities computed as part of the stopping rule. We highlight the computational efficiency of EBC and EBC-H by comparing their per-sample run time with that of existing algorithms. The asymptotic optimality of EBC is supported through simulations on the synthetic datasets. Through simulations on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we show the performance gain of EBC and EBC-H over existing approaches.]]></description>

While much of the current research in deep learning-based vulnerability detection relies on disassembled binaries, this paper explores the feasibility of extracting features directly from raw x86-64 machine code. Although assembly language is more interpretable for humans, it requires more complex models to capture token-level context. In contrast, machine code may enable more efficient, lightweight models and preserve all information that might be lost in disassembly. This paper approaches the task of vulnerability detection through an exploratory study on two specific deep learning model architectures and aims to systematically evaluate their performance across three vulnerability types. The results demonstrate that graph-based models consistently outperform sequential models, emphasizing the importance of control flow relationships, and that machine code contains sufficient information for effective vulnerability discovery.]]></description>

Using Artificial Intelligence to improve teaching and learning benefits greater adaptivity and scalability in education. Knowledge Tracing (KT) is recognized for student modeling task due to its superior performance and application potential in education. To this end, we conceptualize and investigate counterfactual explanation as the connection from XAI for KT to education. Counterfactual explanations offer actionable recourse, are inherently causal and local, and easy for educational stakeholders to understand who are often non-experts. We propose KTCF, a counterfactual explanation generation method for KT that accounts for knowledge concept relationships, and a post-processing scheme that converts a counterfactual explanation into a sequence of educational instructions. We experiment on a large-scale educational dataset and show our KTCF method achieves superior and robust performance over existing methods, with improvements ranging from 5.7% to 34% across metrics. Additionally, we provide a qualitative evaluation of our post-processing scheme, demonstrating that the resulting educational instructions help in reducing large study burden. We show that counterfactuals have the potential to advance the responsible and practical use of AI in education. Future works on XAI for KT may benefit from educationally grounded conceptualization and developing stakeholder-centered methods.]]></description>

Robustness to natural corruptions remains a critical challenge for reliable deep learning, particularly in safety-sensitive domains. We study a family of model-based training approaches that leverage a learned nuisance variation model to generate realistic corruptions, as well as new hybrid strategies that combine random coverage with adversarial refinement in nuisance space. Using the Challenging Unreal and Real Environments for Traffic Sign Recognition dataset (CURE-TSR), with Snow and Rain corruptions, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and training complexity across corruption severities. Our results show that model-based methods consistently outperform baselines Vanilla, Adversarial Training, and AugMix baselines, with model-based adversarial training providing the strongest robustness under across all corruptions but at the expense of higher computation and model-based data augmentation achieving comparable robustness with $T$ less computational complexity without incurring a statistically significant drop in performance. These findings highlight the importance of learned nuisance models for capturing natural variability, and suggest a promising path toward more resilient and calibrated models under challenging conditions.]]></description>

This paper introduces PRA, an AI-agent design for simulating how individual users form privacy concerns in response to real-world news. Moving beyond population-level sentiment analysis, PRA integrates privacy and cognitive theories to simulate user-specific privacy reasoning grounded in personal comment histories and contextual cues. The agent reconstructs each user's "privacy mind", dynamically activates relevant privacy memory through a contextual filter that emulates bounded rationality, and generates synthetic comments reflecting how that user would likely respond to new privacy scenarios. A complementary LLM-as-a-Judge evaluator, calibrated against an established privacy concern taxonomy, quantifies the faithfulness of generated reasoning. Experiments on real-world Hacker News discussions show that \PRA outperforms baseline agents in privacy concern prediction and captures transferable reasoning patterns across domains including AI, e-commerce, and healthcare.]]></description>

Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate potential to estimate the probability of uncertain events, by leveraging their extensive knowledge and reasoning capabilities. This ability can be applied to support intelligent decision-making across diverse fields, such as financial forecasting and preventive healthcare. However, directly prompting LLMs for probability estimation faces significant challenges: their outputs are often noisy, and the underlying predicting process is opaque. In this paper, we propose PRISM: Probability Reconstruction via Shapley Measures, a framework that brings transparency and precision to LLM-based probability estimation. PRISM decomposes an LLM's prediction by quantifying the marginal contribution of each input factor using Shapley values. These factor-level contributions are then aggregated to reconstruct a calibrated final estimate. In our experiments, we demonstrate PRISM improves predictive accuracy over direct prompting and other baselines, across multiple domains including finance, healthcare, and agriculture. Beyond performance, PRISM provides a transparent prediction pipeline: our case studies visualize how individual factors shape the final estimate, helping build trust in LLM-based decision support systems.]]></description>

Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable supervision-free industrial inspection. However, existing ZSAD paradigms are constrained by single visual backbones, which struggle to balance global semantic generalization with fine-grained structural discriminability. To bridge this gap, we propose Synergistic Semantic-Visual Prompting (SSVP), that efficiently fuses diverse visual encodings to elevate model's fine-grained perception. Specifically, SSVP introduces the Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Synergy (HSVS) mechanism, which deeply integrates DINOv3's multi-scale structural priors into the CLIP semantic space. Subsequently, the Vision-Conditioned Prompt Generator (VCPG) employs cross-modal attention to guide dynamic prompt generation, enabling linguistic queries to precisely anchor to specific anomaly patterns. Furthermore, to address the discrepancy between global scoring and local evidence, the Visual-Text Anomaly Mapper (VTAM) establishes a dual-gated calibration paradigm. Extensive evaluations on seven industrial benchmarks validate the robustness of our method; SSVP achieves state-of-the-art performance with 93.0\% Image-AUROC and 92.2\% Pixel-AUROC on MVTec-AD, significantly outperforming existing zero-shot approaches.]]></description>

Neural operator learning accelerates PDE solution by approximating operators as mappings between continuous function spaces. Yet in many engineering settings, varying geometry induces discrete structural changes, including topological changes, abrupt changes in boundary conditions or boundary types, and changes in the effective computational domain, which break the smooth-variation premise. Here we introduce Discrete Solution Operator Learning (DiSOL), a complementary paradigm that learns discrete solution procedures rather than continuous function-space operators. DiSOL factorizes the solver into learnable stages that mirror classical discretizations: local contribution encoding, multiscale assembly, and implicit solution reconstruction on an embedded grid, thereby preserving procedure-level consistency while adapting to geometry-dependent discrete structures. Across geometry-dependent Poisson, advection-diffusion, linear elasticity, as well as spatiotemporal heat-conduction problems, DiSOL produces stable and accurate predictions under both in-distribution and strongly out-of-distribution geometries, including discontinuous boundaries and topological changes. These results highlight the need for procedural operator representations in geometry-dominated regimes and position discrete solution operator learning as a distinct, complementary direction in scientific machine learning.]]></description>

Detecting evasive answers in earnings calls is critical for financial transparency, yet progress is hindered by the lack of large-scale benchmarks. We introduce EvasionBench, comprising 30,000 training samples and 1,000 human-annotated test samples (Cohen's Kappa 0.835) across three evasion levels. Our key contribution is a multi-model annotation framework leveraging a core insight: disagreement between frontier LLMs signals hard examples most valuable for training. We mine boundary cases where two strong annotators conflict, using a judge to resolve labels. This approach outperforms single-model distillation by 2.4 percent, with judge-resolved samples improving generalization despite higher training loss (0.421 vs 0.393) - evidence that disagreement mining acts as implicit regularization. Our trained model Eva-4B (4B parameters) achieves 81.3 percent accuracy, outperforming its base by 25 percentage points and approaching frontier LLM performance at a fraction of inference cost.]]></description>

Large Language Model (LLM) outputs often vary across user sociodemographic attributes, leading to disparities in factual accuracy, utility, and safety, even for objective questions where demographic information is irrelevant. Unlike prior work on stereotypical or representational bias, this paper studies identity-dependent degradation of core response quality. We show empirically that such degradation arises from biased generation behavior, despite factual knowledge being robustly encoded across identities. Motivated by this mismatch, we propose a lightweight, training-free framework for identity-robust generation that selectively neutralizes non-critical identity information while preserving semantically essential attributes, thus maintaining output content integrity. Experiments across four benchmarks and 18 sociodemographic identities demonstrate an average 77% reduction in identity-dependent bias compared to vanilla prompting and a 45% reduction relative to prompt-based defenses. Our work addresses a critical gap in mitigating the impact of user identity cues in prompts on core generation quality.]]></description>

General-purpose Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), despite their massive scale, often falter in dermatology due to "diffuse attention" - the inability to disentangle subtle pathological lesions from background noise. In this paper, we challenge the assumption that parameter scaling is the only path to medical precision. We introduce SkinFlow, a framework that treats diagnosis as an optimization of visual information transmission efficiency. Our approach utilizes a Virtual-Width Dynamic Vision Encoder (DVE) to "unfold" complex pathological manifolds without physical parameter expansion, coupled with a two-stage Reinforcement Learning strategy. This strategy sequentially aligns explicit medical descriptions (Stage I) and reconstructs implicit diagnostic textures (Stage II) within a constrained semantic space. Furthermore, we propose a clinically grounded evaluation protocol that prioritizes diagnostic safety and hierarchical relevance over rigid label matching. Empirical results are compelling: our 7B model establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Fitzpatrick17k benchmark, achieving a +12.06% gain in Top-1 accuracy and a +28.57% boost in Top-6 accuracy over the massive general-purpose models (e.g., Qwen3VL-235B and GPT-5.2). These findings demonstrate that optimizing geometric capacity and information flow yields superior diagnostic reasoning compared to raw parameter scaling.]]></description>

Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained rapid adoption in computational pathology for their ability to model long-range dependencies through self-attention, addressing the limitations of convolutional neural networks that excel at local pattern capture but struggle with global contextual reasoning. Recent pathology-specific foundation models have further advanced performance by leveraging large-scale pretraining. However, standard ViTs remain inherently non-equivariant to transformations such as rotations and reflections, which are ubiquitous variations in histopathology imaging. To address this limitation, we propose Equi-ViT, which integrates an equivariant convolution kernel into the patch embedding stage of a ViT architecture, imparting built-in rotational equivariance to learned representations. Equi-ViT achieves superior rotation-consistent patch embeddings and stable classification performance across image orientations. Our results on a public colorectal cancer dataset demonstrate that incorporating equivariant patch embedding enhances data efficiency and robustness, suggesting that equivariant transformers could potentially serve as more generalizable backbones for the application of ViT in histopathology, such as digital pathology foundation models.]]></description>

Single-domain generalized deep metric learning (SDG-DML) faces the dual challenge of both category and domain shifts during testing, limiting real-world applications. Therefore, aiming to learn better generalization ability on both unseen categories and domains is a realistic goal for the SDG-DML task. To deliver the aspiration, existing SDG-DML methods employ the domain expansion-equalization strategy to expand the source data and generate out-of-distribution samples. However, these methods rely on proxy-based expansion, which tends to generate samples clustered near class proxies, failing to simulate the broad and distant domain shifts encountered in practice. To alleviate the problem, we propose CenterPolar, a novel SDG-DML framework that dynamically expands and constrains domain distributions to learn a generalizable DML model for wider target domain distributions. Specifically, \textbf{CenterPolar} contains two collaborative class-centric polarization phases: (1) Class-Centric Centrifugal Expansion ($C^3E$) and (2) Class-Centric Centripetal Constraint ($C^4$). In the first phase, $C^3E$ drives the source domain distribution by shifting the source data away from class centroids using centrifugal expansion to generalize to more unseen domains. In the second phase, to consolidate domain-invariant class information for the generalization ability to unseen categories, $C^4$ pulls all seen and unseen samples toward their class centroids while enforcing inter-class separation via centripetal constraint. Extensive experimental results on widely used CUB-200-2011 Ext., Cars196 Ext., DomainNet, PACS, and Office-Home datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our CenterPolar over existing state-of-the-art methods. The code will be released after acceptance.]]></description>

Current patent claim generation systems face three fundamental limitations: poor cross-jurisdictional generalization, inadequate semantic relationship modeling between claims and prior art, and unreliable quality assessment. We introduce a novel three-stage framework that addresses these challenges through relationship-aware similarity analysis, domain-adaptive claim generation, and unified quality assessment. Our approach employs multi-head attention with eight specialized heads for explicit relationship modeling, integrates curriculum learning with dynamic LoRA adapter selection across five patent domains, and implements cross-attention mechanisms between evaluation aspects for comprehensive quality assessment. Extensive experiments on USPTO HUPD dataset, EPO patent collections, and Patent-CE benchmark demonstrate substantial improvements: 7.6-point ROUGE-L gain over GPT-4o, 8.3\% BERTScore enhancement over Llama-3.1-8B, and 0.847 correlation with human experts compared to 0.623 for separate evaluation models. Our method maintains 89.4\% cross-jurisdictional performance retention versus 76.2\% for baselines, establishing a comprehensive solution for automated patent prosecution workflows.]]></description>

Fine-grained labor market analysis increasingly relies on mapping unstructured job advertisements to standardized skill taxonomies such as ESCO. This mapping is naturally formulated as an Extreme Multi-Label Classification (XMLC) problem, but supervised solutions are constrained by the scarcity and cost of large-scale, taxonomy-aligned annotations--especially in non-English settings where job-ad language diverges substantially from formal skill definitions. We propose a zero-shot skill extraction framework that eliminates the need for manually labeled job-ad training data. The framework uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to synthesize training instances from ESCO definitions, and introduces hierarchically constrained multi-skill generation based on ESCO Level-2 categories to improve semantic coherence in multi-label contexts. On top of the synthetic corpus, we train a contrastive bi-encoder that aligns job-ad sentences with ESCO skill descriptions in a shared embedding space; the encoder augments a BERT backbone with BiLSTM and attention pooling to better model long, information-dense requirement statements. An upstream RoBERTa-based binary filter removes non-skill sentences to improve end-to-end precision. Experiments show that (i) hierarchy-conditioned generation improves both fluency and discriminability relative to unconstrained pairing, and (ii) the resulting multi-label model transfers effectively to real-world Chinese job advertisements, achieving strong zero-shot retrieval performance (F1@5 = 0.72) and outperforming TF--IDF and standard BERT baselines. Overall, the proposed pipeline provides a scalable, data-efficient pathway for automated skill coding in labor economics and workforce analytics.]]></description>

This paper addresses the limitations of current vision-based rail defect detection methods, including high computational complexity, excessive parameter counts, and suboptimal accuracy. We propose a Lightweight Pyramid Cross-Attention Network (LPCANet) that leverages RGB-D data for efficient and accurate defect identification. The architecture integrates MobileNetv2 as a backbone for RGB feature extraction with a lightweight pyramid module (LPM) for depth processing, coupled with a cross-attention mechanism (CAM) for multimodal fusion and a spatial feature extractor (SFE) for enhanced structural analysis. Comprehensive evaluations on three unsupervised RGB-D rail datasets (NEU-RSDDS-AUG, RSDD-TYPE1, RSDD-TYPE2) demonstrate that LPCANet achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 9.90 million parameters, 2.50 G FLOPs, and 162.60 fps inference speed. Compared to 18 existing methods, LPCANet shows significant improvements, including +1.48\% in $S_α$, +0.86\% in IOU, and +1.77\% in MAE over the best-performing baseline. Ablation studies confirm the critical roles of CAM and SFE, while experiments on non-rail datasets (DAGM2007, MT, Kolektor-SDD2) validate its generalization capability. The proposed framework effectively bridges traditional and deep learning approaches, offering substantial practical value for industrial defect inspection. Future work will focus on further model compression for real-time deployment.]]></description>

Generative AI systems increasingly enable the production of highly realistic synthetic media. Civitai, a popular community-driven platform for AI-generated content, operates a monetized feature called Bounties, which allows users to commission the generation of content in exchange for payment. To examine how this mechanism is used and what content it incentivizes, we conduct a longitudinal analysis of all publicly available bounty requests collected over a 14-month period following the platform's launch. We find that the bounty marketplace is dominated by tools that let users steer AI models toward content they were not trained to generate. At the same time, requests for content that is "Not Safe For Work" are widespread and have increased steadily over time, now comprising a majority of all bounties. Participation in bounty creation is uneven, with 20% of requesters accounting for roughly half of requests. Requests for "deepfake" - media depicting identifiable real individuals - exhibit a higher concentration than other types of bounties. A nontrivial subset of these requests involves explicit deepfakes despite platform policies prohibiting such content. These bounties disproportionately target female celebrities, revealing a pronounced gender asymmetry in social harm. Together, these findings show how monetized, community-driven generative AI platforms can produce gendered harms, raising questions about consent, governance, and enforcement.]]></description>

Real-world License Plate Recognition (LPR) faces significant challenges from severe degradations such as motion blur, low resolution, and complex illumination. The prevailing "restoration-then-recognition" two-stage paradigm suffers from a fundamental flaw: the pixel-level optimization objectives of image restoration models are misaligned with the semantic goals of character recognition, leading to artifact interference and error accumulation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated powerful general capabilities, they lack explicit structural modeling for license plate character sequences (e.g., fixed length, specific order). To address this, we propose an end-to-end structure-aware multimodal reasoning framework based on Qwen3-VL. The core innovation lies in the Character-Aware Multimodal Reasoning Module (CMRM), which introduces a set of learnable Character Slot Queries. Through a cross-attention mechanism, these queries actively retrieve fine-grained evidence corresponding to character positions from visual features. Subsequently, we inject these character-aware representations back into the visual tokens via residual modulation, enabling the language model to perform autoregressive generation based on explicit structural priors. Furthermore, combined with the LoRA parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, the model achieves domain adaptation while retaining the generalization capabilities of the large model. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world severely degraded datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing restoration-recognition combinations and general VLMs, validating the superiority of incorporating structured reasoning into large models for low-quality text recognition tasks.]]></description>

The GEneral Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) is one of the essential algorithms in scientific computing. Single-thread GEMM implementations are well-optimised with techniques like blocking and autotuning. However, due to the complexity of modern multi-core shared memory systems, it is challenging to determine the number of threads that minimises the multi-thread GEMM runtime. We present a proof-of-concept approach to building an Architecture and Data-Structure Aware Linear Algebra (ADSALA) software library that uses machine learning to optimise the runtime performance of BLAS routines. More specifically, our method uses a machine learning model on-the-fly to automatically select the optimal number of threads for a given GEMM task based on the collected training data. Test results on two different HPC node architectures, one based on a two-socket Intel Cascade Lake and the other on a two-socket AMD Zen 3, revealed a 25 to 40 per cent speedup compared to traditional GEMM implementations in BLAS when using GEMM of memory usage within 100 MB.]]></description>

Memory plays a foundational role in augmenting the reasoning, adaptability, and contextual fidelity of modern Large Language Models and Multi-Modal LLMs. As these models transition from static predictors to interactive systems capable of continual learning and personalized inference, the incorporation of memory mechanisms has emerged as a central theme in their architectural and functional evolution. This survey presents a comprehensive and structured synthesis of memory in LLMs and MLLMs, organizing the literature into a cohesive taxonomy comprising implicit, explicit, and agentic memory paradigms. Specifically, the survey delineates three primary memory frameworks. Implicit memory refers to the knowledge embedded within the internal parameters of pre-trained transformers, encompassing their capacity for memorization, associative retrieval, and contextual reasoning. Recent work has explored methods to interpret, manipulate, and reconfigure this latent memory. Explicit memory involves external storage and retrieval components designed to augment model outputs with dynamic, queryable knowledge representations, such as textual corpora, dense vectors, and graph-based structures, thereby enabling scalable and updatable interaction with information sources. Agentic memory introduces persistent, temporally extended memory structures within autonomous agents, facilitating long-term planning, self-consistency, and collaborative behavior in multi-agent systems, with relevance to embodied and interactive AI. Extending beyond text, the survey examines the integration of memory within multi-modal settings, where coherence across vision, language, audio, and action modalities is essential. Key architectural advances, benchmark tasks, and open challenges are discussed, including issues related to memory capacity, alignment, factual consistency, and cross-system interoperability.]]></description>

Vision-Language Navigation aims to enable agents to navigate to a target location based on language instructions. Traditional VLN often follows a close-set assumption, i.e., training and test data share the same style of the input images and instructions. However, the real world is open and filled with various unseen environments, posing enormous difficulties for close-set methods. To this end, we focus on the General Scene Adaptation (GSA-VLN) task, aiming to learn generalized navigation ability by introducing diverse environments and inconsistent intructions.Towards this task, when facing unseen environments and instructions, the challenge mainly lies in how to enable the agent to dynamically produce generalized strategies during the navigation process. Recent research indicates that by means of fast and slow cognition systems, human beings could generate stable policies, which strengthen their adaptation for open world. Inspired by this idea, we propose the slow4fast-VLN, establishing a dynamic interactive fast-slow reasoning framework. The fast-reasoning module, an end-to-end strategy network, outputs actions via real-time input. It accumulates execution records in a history repository to build memory. The slow-reasoning module analyze the memories generated by the fast-reasoning module. Through deep reflection, it extracts experiences that enhance the generalization ability of decision-making. These experiences are structurally stored and used to continuously optimize the fast-reasoning module. Unlike traditional methods that treat fast-slow reasoning as independent mechanisms, our framework enables fast-slow interaction. By leveraging the experiences from slow reasoning. This interaction allows the system to continuously adapt and efficiently execute navigation tasks when facing unseen scenarios.]]></description>

Few-shot semantic segmentation of time-series remote sensing images remains a critical challenge, particularly in regions where labeled data is scarce or costly to obtain. While state-of-the-art models perform well under full supervision, their performance degrades significantly under limited labeling, limiting their real-world applicability. In this work, we propose SAM-Aug, a new annotation-efficient framework that leverages the geometry-aware segmentation capability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to improve few-shot land cover mapping. Our approach constructs cloud-free composite images from temporal sequences and applies SAM in a fully unsupervised manner to generate geometry-aware mask priors. These priors are then integrated into training through a proposed loss function called RegionSmoothLoss, which enforces prediction consistency within each SAM-derived region across temporal frames, effectively regularizing the model to respect semantically coherent structures. Extensive experiments on the PASTIS-R benchmark under a 5 percent labeled setting demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SAM-Aug. Averaged over three random seeds (42, 2025, 4090), our method achieves a mean test mIoU of 36.21 percent, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline by +2.33 percentage points, a relative improvement of 6.89 percent. Notably, on the most favorable split (seed=42), SAM-Aug reaches a test mIoU of 40.28 percent, representing an 11.2 percent relative gain with no additional labeled data. The consistent improvement across all seeds confirms the generalization power of leveraging foundation model priors under annotation scarcity. Our results highlight that vision models like SAM can serve as useful regularizers in few-shot remote sensing learning, offering a scalable and plug-and-play solution for land cover monitoring without requiring manual annotations or model fine-tuning.]]></description>

Accurately localizing and segmenting relevant objects from optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) is critical for advancing remote sensing applications. Existing methods are typically built upon moderate-scale pre-trained models and employ diverse optimization strategies to achieve promising performance under full-parameter fine-tuning. In fact, deeper and larger-scale foundation models can provide stronger support for performance improvement. However, due to their massive number of parameters, directly adopting full-parameter fine-tuning leads to pronounced training difficulties, such as excessive GPU memory consumption and high computational costs, which result in extremely limited exploration of large-scale models in existing works. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic wavelet expert-guided fine-tuning paradigm with fewer trainable parameters, dubbed WEFT, which efficiently adapts large-scale foundation models to ORSIs segmentation tasks by leveraging the guidance of wavelet experts. Specifically, we introduce a task-specific wavelet expert extractor to model wavelet experts from different perspectives and dynamically regulate their outputs, thereby generating trainable features enriched with task-specific information for subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we construct an expert-guided conditional adapter that first enhances the fine-grained perception of frozen features for specific tasks by injecting trainable features, and then iteratively updates the information of both types of feature, allowing for efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that our WEFT not only outperforms 21 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three ORSIs datasets, but also achieves optimal results in camouflage, natural, and medical scenarios.

Accurate localisation in planetary robotics enables the advanced autonomy required to support the increased scale and scope of future missions. The successes of the Ingenuity helicopter and multiple planetary orbiters lay the groundwork for future missions that use ground-aerial robotic teams. In this paper, we consider rovers using machine learning to localise themselves in a local aerial map using limited field-of-view monocular ground-view RGB images as input. A key consideration for machine learning methods is that real space data with ground-truth position labels suitable for training is scarce. In this work, we propose a novel method of localising rovers in an aerial map using cross-view-localising dual-encoder deep neural networks. We leverage semantic segmentation with vision foundation models and high volume synthetic data to bridge the domain gap to real images. We also contribute a new cross-view dataset of real-world rover trajectories with corresponding ground-truth localisation data captured in a planetary analogue facility, plus a high volume dataset of analogous synthetic image pairs. Using particle filters for state estimation with the cross-view networks allows accurate position estimation over simple and complex trajectories based on sequences of ground-view images.]]></description>

Civil aviation is a cornerstone of global transportation and commerce, and ensuring its safety, efficiency and customer satisfaction is paramount. Yet conventional Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions in aviation remain siloed and narrow, focusing on isolated tasks or single modalities. They struggle to integrate heterogeneous data such as voice communications, radar tracks, sensor streams and textual reports, which limits situational awareness, adaptability, and real-time decision support. This paper introduces the vision of AviationLMM, a Large Multimodal foundation Model for civil aviation, designed to unify the heterogeneous data streams of civil aviation and enable understanding, reasoning, generation and agentic applications. We firstly identify the gaps between existing AI solutions and requirements. Secondly, we describe the model architecture that ingests multimodal inputs such as air-ground voice, surveillance, on-board telemetry, video and structured texts, and performs cross-modal alignment and fusion, and produces flexible outputs ranging from situation summaries and risk alerts to predictive diagnostics and multimodal incident reconstructions. In order to fully realize this vision, we identify key research opportunities to address, including data acquisition, alignment and fusion, pretraining, reasoning, trustworthiness, privacy, robustness to missing modalities, and synthetic scenario generation. By articulating the design and challenges of AviationLMM, we aim to boost the civil aviation foundation model progress and catalyze coordinated research efforts toward an integrated, trustworthy and privacy-preserving aviation AI ecosystem.]]></description>

System logs are crucial for monitoring and diagnosing modern computing infrastructure, but their scale and complexity require reliable and efficient automated interpretation. Since severity levels are predefined metadata in system log messages, having a model merely classify them offers limited standalone practical value, revealing little about its underlying ability to interpret system logs. We argue that severity classification is more informative when treated as a benchmark for probing runtime log comprehension rather than as an end task. Using real-world journalctl data from Linux production servers, we evaluate nine small language models (SLMs) and small reasoning language models (SRLMs) under zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) prompting. The results reveal strong stratification. Qwen3-4B achieves the highest accuracy at 95.64% with RAG, while Gemma3-1B improves from 20.25% under few-shot prompting to 85.28% with RAG. Notably, the tiny Qwen3-0.6B reaches 88.12% accuracy despite weak performance without retrieval. In contrast, several SRLMs, including Qwen3-1.7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, degrade substantially when paired with RAG. Efficiency measurements further separate models: most Gemma and Llama variants complete inference in under 1.2 seconds per log, whereas Phi-4-Mini-Reasoning exceeds 228 seconds per log while achieving <10% accuracy. These findings suggest that (1) architectural design, (2) training objectives, and (3) the ability to integrate retrieved context under strict output constraints jointly determine performance. By emphasizing small, deployable models, this benchmark aligns with real-time requirements of digital twin (DT) systems and shows that severity classification serves as a lens for evaluating model competence and real-time deployability, with implications for root cause analysis (RCA) and broader DT integration.]]></description>
