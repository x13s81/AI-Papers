When humans face problems beyond their immediate capabilities, they rely on tools, providing a promising paradigm for improving visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Effective reasoning, therefore, hinges on knowing which tools to use, when to invoke them, and how to compose them over multiple steps, even when faced with new tools or new tasks. We introduce AdaReasoner, a family of multimodal models that learn tool use as a general reasoning skill rather than as tool-specific or explicitly supervised behavior. AdaReasoner is enabled by (i) a scalable data curation pipeline exposing models to long-horizon, multi-step tool interactions; (ii) Tool-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes tool selection and sequencing based on end-task success; and (iii) an adaptive learning mechanism that dynamically regulates tool usage. Together, these components allow models to infer tool utility from task context and intermediate outcomes, enabling coordination of multiple tools and generalization to unseen tools. Empirically, AdaReasoner exhibits strong tool-adaptive and generalization behaviors: it autonomously adopts beneficial tools, suppresses irrelevant ones, and adjusts tool usage frequency based on task demands, despite never being explicitly trained to do so. These capabilities translate into state-of-the-art performance across challenging benchmarks, improving the 7B base model by +24.9\% on average and surpassing strong proprietary systems such as GPT-5 on multiple tasks, including VSP and Jigsaw.]]></description>

Humans construct internal world models and reason by manipulating the concepts within these models. Recent advances in AI, particularly chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, approximate such human cognitive abilities, where world models are believed to be embedded within large language models. Expert-level performance in formal and abstract domains such as mathematics and programming has been achieved in current systems by relying predominantly on verbal reasoning. However, they still lag far behind humans in domains like physical and spatial intelligence, which require richer representations and prior knowledge. The emergence of unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of both verbal and visual generation has therefore sparked interest in more human-like reasoning grounded in complementary multimodal pathways, though their benefits remain unclear. From a world-model perspective, this paper presents the first principled study of when and how visual generation benefits reasoning. Our key position is the visual superiority hypothesis: for certain tasks--particularly those grounded in the physical world--visual generation more naturally serves as world models, whereas purely verbal world models encounter bottlenecks arising from representational limitations or insufficient prior knowledge. Theoretically, we formalize internal world modeling as a core component of CoT reasoning and analyze distinctions among different forms of world models. Empirically, we identify tasks that necessitate interleaved visual-verbal CoT reasoning, constructing a new evaluation suite, VisWorld-Eval. Controlled experiments on a state-of-the-art UMM show that interleaved CoT significantly outperforms purely verbal CoT on tasks that favor visual world modeling, but offers no clear advantage otherwise. Together, this work clarifies the potential of multimodal world modeling for more powerful, human-like multimodal AI.]]></description>

Large language model (LLM) scaling is hitting a wall. Widening models yields diminishing returns, and extending context length does not improve fundamental expressivity. In contrast, depth scaling offers theoretically superior expressivity, yet current Transformer architectures struggle to train reliably at extreme depths. We revisit the Post-LayerNorm (Post-LN) formulation, whose instability at scale caused its replacement by Pre-LN in modern LLMs. We show that the central failure mode of Post-LN arises from the ResNet-style residual pathway, which introduces gradient vanishing in deep networks. We present Keel, a Post-LN Transformer that replaces this residual path with a Highway-style connection. This modification preserves the gradient flow through the residual branch, preventing signal vanishing from the top layers to the bottom. Unlike prior methods, Keel enables stable training at extreme depths without requiring specialized initialization or complex optimization tricks. Keel trains robustly at depths exceeding 1000 layers and consistently improves perplexity and depth-scaling characteristics over Pre-LN. These findings indicate that Post-LN, when paired with a Highway-style connection, provides a simple and effective foundation for building deeply scalable LLMs, opening the possibility for future infinite-depth architectures.]]></description>

We present SimpleSeg, a strikingly simple yet highly effective approach to endow Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with native pixel-level perception. Our method reframes segmentation as a simple sequence generation problem: the model directly predicts sequences of points (textual coordinates) delineating object boundaries, entirely within its language space. To achieve high fidelity, we introduce a two-stage SFtoRL training pipeline, where Reinforcement Learning with an IoU-based reward refines the point sequences to accurately match ground-truth contours. We find that the standard MLLM architecture possesses a strong, inherent capacity for low-level perception that can be unlocked without any specialized architecture. On segmentation benchmarks, SimpleSeg achieves performance that is comparable to, and often surpasses, methods relying on complex, task-specific designs. This work lays out that precise spatial understanding can emerge from simple point prediction, challenging the prevailing need for auxiliary components and paving the way for more unified and capable VLMs. Homepage: https://simpleseg.github.io/]]></description>

Continual learning, enabling models to acquire new skills and knowledge without degrading existing capabilities, remains a fundamental challenge for foundation models. While on-policy reinforcement learning can reduce forgetting, it requires explicit reward functions that are often unavailable. Learning from expert demonstrations, the primary alternative, is dominated by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is inherently off-policy. We introduce Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT), a simple method that enables on-policy learning directly from demonstrations. SDFT leverages in-context learning by using a demonstration-conditioned model as its own teacher, generating on-policy training signals that preserve prior capabilities while acquiring new skills. Across skill learning and knowledge acquisition tasks, SDFT consistently outperforms SFT, achieving higher new-task accuracy while substantially reducing catastrophic forgetting. In sequential learning experiments, SDFT enables a single model to accumulate multiple skills over time without performance regression, establishing on-policy distillation as a practical path to continual learning from demonstrations.]]></description>

In recent years, safety risks associated with large language models have become increasingly prominent, highlighting the urgent need to mitigate the generation of toxic and harmful content. The mainstream paradigm for LLM safety alignment typically adopts a collaborative framework involving three roles: an attacker for adversarial prompt generation, a defender for safety defense, and an evaluator for response assessment. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop reinforcement learning framework called TriPlay-RL that enables iterative and co-improving collaboration among three roles with near-zero manual annotation. Experimental results show that the attacker preserves high output diversity while achieving a 20%-50% improvement in adversarial effectiveness; the defender attains 10%-30% gains in safety performance without degrading general reasoning capability; and the evaluator continuously refines its fine-grained judgment ability through iterations, accurately distinguishing unsafe responses, simple refusals, and useful guidance. Overall, our framework establishes an efficient and scalable paradigm for LLM safety alignment, enabling continuous co-evolution within a unified learning loop.]]></description>

Despite the syntactic fluency of Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring their logical correctness in high-stakes domains remains a fundamental challenge. We present a neurosymbolic framework that combines LLMs with SMT solvers to produce verification-guided answers through iterative refinement. Our approach decomposes LLM outputs into atomic claims, autoformalizes them into first-order logic, and verifies their logical consistency using automated theorem proving. We introduce three key innovations: (1) multi-model consensus via formal semantic equivalence checking to ensure logic-level alignment between candidates, eliminating the syntactic bias of surface-form metrics, (2) semantic routing that directs different claim types to appropriate verification strategies: symbolic solvers for logical claims and LLM ensembles for commonsense reasoning, and (3) precise logical error localization via Minimal Correction Subsets (MCS), which pinpoint the exact subset of claims to revise, transforming binary failure signals into actionable feedback. Our framework classifies claims by their logical status and aggregates multiple verification signals into a unified score with variance-based penalty. The system iteratively refines answers using structured feedback until acceptance criteria are met or convergence is achieved. This hybrid approach delivers formal guarantees where possible and consensus verification elsewhere, advancing trustworthy AI. With the GPT-OSS-120B model, VERGE demonstrates an average performance uplift of 18.7% at convergence across a set of reasoning benchmarks compared to single-pass approaches.]]></description>

Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents show great potential for enabling foundation models to complete real-world tasks, revolutionizing human-computer interaction and improving human productivity. In this report, we present OmegaUse, a general-purpose GUI agent model for autonomous task execution on both mobile and desktop platforms, supporting computer-use and phone-use scenarios. Building an effective GUI agent model relies on two factors: (1) high-quality data and (2) effective training methods. To address these, we introduce a carefully engineered data-construction pipeline and a decoupled training paradigm. For data construction, we leverage rigorously curated open-source datasets and introduce a novel automated synthesis framework that integrates bottom-up autonomous exploration with top-down taxonomy-guided generation to create high-fidelity synthetic data. For training, to better leverage these data, we adopt a two-stage strategy: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to establish fundamental interaction syntax, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve spatial grounding and sequential planning. To balance computational efficiency with agentic reasoning capacity, OmegaUse is built on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone. To evaluate cross-terminal capabilities in an offline setting, we introduce OS-Nav, a benchmark suite spanning multiple operating systems: ChiM-Nav, targeting Chinese Android mobile environments, and Ubu-Nav, focusing on routine desktop interactions on Ubuntu. Extensive experiments show that OmegaUse is highly competitive across established GUI benchmarks, achieving a state-of-the-art (SOTA) score of 96.3% on ScreenSpot-V2 and a leading 79.1% step success rate on AndroidControl. OmegaUse also performs strongly on OS-Nav, reaching 74.24% step success on ChiM-Nav and 55.9% average success on Ubu-Nav.]]></description>

Large language models (LLMs) have progressed rapidly; however, most state-of-the-art models are trained and evaluated primarily in high-resource languages such as English and Chinese, and are often developed by a small number of organizations with access to large-scale compute and data. This gatekeeping creates a practical barrier for sovereign settings in which a regional- or national-scale institution or domain owner must retain control and understanding of model weights, training data, and deployment while operating under limited resources and strict transparency constraints. To this end, we identify two core requirements: (1) adoptability, the ability to transform a base model into a general-purpose assistant, and (2) sovereign capability, the ability to perform high-stakes, region-specific tasks (e.g., legal reasoning in local languages and cultural knowledge). We investigate whether these requirements can be achieved without scaling massive instruction corpora or relying on complex preference tuning pipelines and large-scale reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We present Typhoon S, a minimal and open post-training recipe that combines supervised fine-tuning, on-policy distillation, and small-scale RFT. Using Thai as a representative case study, we demonstrate that our approach transforms both sovereign-adapted and general-purpose base models into instruction-tuned models with strong general performance. We further show that small-scale RFT with InK-GRPO -- an extension of GRPO that augments the GRPO loss with a next-word prediction loss -- improves Thai legal reasoning and Thai-specific knowledge while preserving general capabilities. Our results suggest that a carefully designed post-training strategy can reduce the required scale of instruction data and computation, providing a practical path toward high-quality sovereign LLMs under academic-scale resources.]]></description>

The rise of AI agents introduces complex safety and security challenges arising from autonomous tool use and environmental interactions. Current guardrail models lack agentic risk awareness and transparency in risk diagnosis. To introduce an agentic guardrail that covers complex and numerous risky behaviors, we first propose a unified three-dimensional taxonomy that orthogonally categorizes agentic risks by their source (where), failure mode (how), and consequence (what). Guided by this structured and hierarchical taxonomy, we introduce a new fine-grained agentic safety benchmark (ATBench) and a Diagnostic Guardrail framework for agent safety and security (AgentDoG). AgentDoG provides fine-grained and contextual monitoring across agent trajectories. More Crucially, AgentDoG can diagnose the root causes of unsafe actions and seemingly safe but unreasonable actions, offering provenance and transparency beyond binary labels to facilitate effective agent alignment. AgentDoG variants are available in three sizes (4B, 7B, and 8B parameters) across Qwen and Llama model families. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AgentDoG achieves state-of-the-art performance in agentic safety moderation in diverse and complex interactive scenarios. All models and datasets are openly released.]]></description>

Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) offers a robust mechanism for enhancing mathematical reasoning in large models. However, we identify a systematic lack of emphasis on more challenging questions in existing methods from both algorithmic and data perspectives, despite their importance for refining underdeveloped capabilities. Algorithmically, widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from an implicit imbalance where the magnitude of policy updates is lower for harder questions. Data-wise, augmentation approaches primarily rephrase questions to enhance diversity without systematically increasing intrinsic difficulty. To address these issues, we propose a two-dual MathForge framework to improve mathematical reasoning by targeting harder questions from both perspectives, which comprises a Difficulty-Aware Group Policy Optimization (DGPO) algorithm and a Multi-Aspect Question Reformulation (MQR) strategy. Specifically, DGPO first rectifies the implicit imbalance in GRPO via difficulty-balanced group advantage estimation, and further prioritizes harder questions by difficulty-aware question-level weighting. Meanwhile, MQR reformulates questions across multiple aspects to increase difficulty while maintaining the original gold answer. Overall, MathForge forms a synergistic loop: MQR expands the data frontier, and DGPO effectively learns from the augmented data. Extensive experiments show that MathForge significantly outperforms existing methods on various mathematical reasoning tasks. The code and augmented data are all available at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/MathForge.]]></description>

We present Innovator-VL, a scientific multimodal large language model designed to advance understanding and reasoning across diverse scientific domains while maintaining excellent performance on general vision tasks. Contrary to the trend of relying on massive domain-specific pretraining and opaque pipelines, our work demonstrates that principled training design and transparent methodology can yield strong scientific intelligence with substantially reduced data requirements. (i) First, we provide a fully transparent, end-to-end reproducible training pipeline, covering data collection, cleaning, preprocessing, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and evaluation, along with detailed optimization recipes. This facilitates systematic extension by the community. (ii) Second, Innovator-VL exhibits remarkable data efficiency, achieving competitive performance on various scientific tasks using fewer than five million curated samples without large-scale pretraining. These results highlight that effective reasoning can be achieved through principled data selection rather than indiscriminate scaling. (iii) Third, Innovator-VL demonstrates strong generalization, achieving competitive performance on general vision, multimodal reasoning, and scientific benchmarks. This indicates that scientific alignment can be integrated into a unified model without compromising general-purpose capabilities. Our practices suggest that efficient, reproducible, and high-performing scientific multimodal models can be built even without large-scale data, providing a practical foundation for future research.]]></description>

Offering great potential in robotic manipulation, a capable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) foundation model is expected to faithfully generalize across tasks and platforms while ensuring cost efficiency (e.g., data and GPU hours required for adaptation). To this end, we develop LingBot-VLA with around 20,000 hours of real-world data from 9 popular dual-arm robot configurations. Through a systematic assessment on 3 robotic platforms, each completing 100 tasks with 130 post-training episodes per task, our model achieves clear superiority over competitors, showcasing its strong performance and broad generalizability. We have also built an efficient codebase, which delivers a throughput of 261 samples per second per GPU with an 8-GPU training setup, representing a 1.5~2.8times (depending on the relied VLM base model) speedup over existing VLA-oriented codebases. The above features ensure that our model is well-suited for real-world deployment. To advance the field of robot learning, we provide open access to the code, base model, and benchmark data, with a focus on enabling more challenging tasks and promoting sound evaluation standards.]]></description>

We present DeepSeek-OCR 2 to investigate the feasibility of a novel encoder-DeepEncoder V2-capable of dynamically reordering visual tokens upon image semantics. Conventional vision-language models (VLMs) invariably process visual tokens in a rigid raster-scan order (top-left to bottom-right) with fixed positional encoding when fed into LLMs. However, this contradicts human visual perception, which follows flexible yet semantically coherent scanning patterns driven by inherent logical structures. Particularly for images with complex layouts, human vision exhibits causally-informed sequential processing. Inspired by this cognitive mechanism, DeepEncoder V2 is designed to endow the encoder with causal reasoning capabilities, enabling it to intelligently reorder visual tokens prior to LLM-based content interpretation. This work explores a novel paradigm: whether 2D image understanding can be effectively achieved through two-cascaded 1D causal reasoning structures, thereby offering a new architectural approach with the potential to achieve genuine 2D reasoning. Codes and model weights are publicly accessible at http://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR-2.]]></description>

High-quality evaluation benchmarks are pivotal for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in Automated Code Review (ACR). However, existing benchmarks suffer from two critical limitations: first, the lack of multi-language support in repository-level contexts, which restricts the generalizability of evaluation results; second, the reliance on noisy, incomplete ground truth derived from raw Pull Request (PR) comments, which constrains the scope of issue detection. To address these challenges, we introduce AACR-Bench a comprehensive benchmark that provides full cross-file context across multiple programming languages. Unlike traditional datasets, AACR-Bench employs an "AI-assisted, Expert-verified" annotation pipeline to uncover latent defects often overlooked in original PRs, resulting in a 285% increase in defect coverage. Extensive evaluations of mainstream LLMs on AACR-Bench reveal that previous assessments may have either misjudged or only partially captured model capabilities due to data limitations. Our work establishes a more rigorous standard for ACR evaluation and offers new insights on LLM based ACR, i.e., the granularity/level of context and the choice of retrieval methods significantly impact ACR performance, and this influence varies depending on the LLM, programming language, and the LLM usage paradigm e.g., whether an Agent architecture is employed. The code, data, and other artifacts of our evaluation set are available at https://github.com/alibaba/aacr-bench .]]></description>

Diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art performance but often fail to generate outputs that align with human preferences and intentions, resulting in images with poor aesthetic quality and semantic inconsistencies. Existing alignment methods present a difficult trade-off: fine-tuning approaches suffer from loss of diversity with reward over-optimization, while test-time scaling methods introduce significant computational overhead and tend to under-optimize. To address these limitations, we propose HyperAlign, a novel framework that trains a hypernetwork for efficient and effective test-time alignment. Instead of modifying latent states, HyperAlign dynamically generates low-rank adaptation weights to modulate the diffusion model's generation operators. This allows the denoising trajectory to be adaptively adjusted based on input latents, timesteps and prompts for reward-conditioned alignment. We introduce multiple variants of HyperAlign that differ in how frequently the hypernetwork is applied, balancing between performance and efficiency. Furthermore, we optimize the hypernetwork using a reward score objective regularized with preference data to reduce reward hacking. We evaluate HyperAlign on multiple extended generative paradigms, including Stable Diffusion and FLUX. It significantly outperforms existing fine-tuning and test-time scaling baselines in enhancing semantic consistency and visual appeal.]]></description>

Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has substantially improved the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), yet training often stalls as problems become saturated. We identify the core challenge as the poor accessibility of informative failures: learning signals exist but are rarely encountered during standard rollouts. To address this, we propose failure-prefix conditioning, a simple and effective method for learning from saturated problems. Rather than starting from the original question, our approach reallocates exploration by conditioning training on prefixes derived from rare incorrect reasoning trajectories, thereby exposing the model to failure-prone states. We observe that failure-prefix conditioning yields performance gains matching those of training on medium-difficulty problems, while preserving token efficiency. Furthermore, we analyze the model's robustness, finding that our method reduces performance degradation under misleading failure prefixes, albeit with a mild trade-off in adherence to correct early reasoning. Finally, we demonstrate that an iterative approach, which refreshes failure prefixes during training, unlocks additional gains after performance plateaus. Overall, our results suggest that failure-prefix conditioning offers an effective pathway to extend RLVR training on saturated problems.]]></description>

Benchmarks are important tools to track progress in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet inaccuracies in datasets and evaluation methods consistently undermine their effectiveness. Here, we present Omni-MATH-2, a manually revised version of the Omni-MATH dataset comprising a clean, exact-answer subset (n{=}4181) and a tagged, non-standard subset (n{=}247). Each problem was audited to ensure LaTeX compilability, solvability and verifiability, which involved adding missing figures or information, labeling problems requiring a proof, estimation or image, and removing clutter. This process significantly reduces dataset-induced noise, thereby providing a more precise assessment of model performance. The annotated dataset also allows us to evaluate judge-induced noise by comparing GPT-5 mini with the original Omni-Judge, revealing substantial discrepancies between judges on both the clean and tagged problem subsets. Expert annotations reveal that Omni-Judge is wrong in 96.4% of the judge disagreements, indicating its inability to differentiate between models' abilities, even well before saturation of the benchmark occurs. As problems become more challenging, we find that increasingly competent judges become essential in order to prevent judge errors from masking genuine differences between models. Finally, neither judge identifies the present failure modes for the subset of tagged problems, demonstrating that dataset quality and judge reliability are both critical to develop accurate benchmarks of model performance.]]></description>

Web agents hold great potential for automating complex computer tasks, yet their interactions involve long-horizon, sequential decision-making with irreversible actions. In such settings, outcome-based supervision is sparse and delayed, often rewarding incorrect trajectories and failing to support inference-time scaling. This motivates the use of Process Reward Models (WebPRMs) for web navigation, but existing approaches remain limited: scalar WebPRMs collapse progress into coarse, weakly grounded signals, while checklist-based WebPRMs rely on brittle template matching that fails under layout or semantic changes and often mislabels superficially correct actions as successful, providing little insight or interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce WebArbiter, a reasoning-first, principle-inducing WebPRM that formulates reward modeling as text generation, producing structured justifications that conclude with a preference verdict and identify the action most conducive to task completion under the current context. Training follows a two-stage pipeline: reasoning distillation equips the model with coherent principle-guided reasoning, and reinforcement learning corrects teacher biases by directly aligning verdicts with correctness, enabling stronger generalization. To support systematic evaluation, we release WebPRMBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning four diverse web environments with rich tasks and high-quality preference annotations. On WebPRMBench, WebArbiter-7B outperforms the strongest baseline, GPT-5, by 9.1 points. In reward-guided trajectory search on WebArena-Lite, it surpasses the best prior WebPRM by up to 7.2 points, underscoring its robustness and practical value in real-world complex web tasks.]]></description>

Despite the significant advancements represented by Vision-Language Models (VLMs), current architectures often exhibit limitations in retaining fine-grained visual information, leading to coarse-grained multimodal comprehension. We attribute this deficiency to a suboptimal training paradigm inherent in prevailing VLMs, which exhibits a text-dominant optimization bias by conceptualizing visual signals merely as passive conditional inputs rather than supervisory targets. To mitigate this, we introduce Youtu-VL, a framework leveraging the Vision-Language Unified Autoregressive Supervision (VLUAS) paradigm, which fundamentally shifts the optimization objective from ``vision-as-input'' to ``vision-as-target.'' By integrating visual tokens directly into the prediction stream, Youtu-VL applies unified autoregressive supervision to both visual details and linguistic content. Furthermore, we extend this paradigm to encompass vision-centric tasks, enabling a standard VLM to perform vision-centric tasks without task-specific additions. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Youtu-VL achieves competitive performance on both general multimodal tasks and vision-centric tasks, establishing a robust foundation for the development of comprehensive generalist visual agents.]]></description>

Internet audio-visual clips convey meaning through time-varying sound and motion, which extend beyond what text alone can represent. To examine whether AI models can understand such signals in human cultural contexts, we introduce AVMeme Exam, a human-curated benchmark of over one thousand iconic Internet sounds and videos spanning speech, songs, music, and sound effects. Each meme is paired with a unique Q&A assessing levels of understanding from surface content to context and emotion to usage and world knowledge, along with metadata such as original year, transcript, summary, and sensitivity. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) alongside human participants using this benchmark. Our results reveal a consistent limitation: current models perform poorly on textless music and sound effects, and struggle to think in context and in culture compared to surface content. These findings highlight a key gap in human-aligned multimodal intelligence and call for models that can perceive contextually and culturally beyond the surface of what they hear and see.

Large Language Models (LLMs) motivate generative agent simulation (e.g., AI Town) to create a ``dynamic world'', holding immense value across entertainment and research. However, for non-experts, especially those without programming skills, it isn't easy to customize a visualizable environment by themselves. In this paper, we introduce World Craft, an agentic world creation framework to create an executable and visualizable AI Town via user textual descriptions. It consists of two main modules, World Scaffold and World Guild. World Scaffold is a structured and concise standardization to develop interactive game scenes, serving as an efficient scaffolding for LLMs to customize an executable AI Town-like environment. World Guild is a multi-agent framework to progressively analyze users' intents from rough descriptions, and synthesizes required structured contents (\eg environment layout and assets) for World Scaffold . Moreover, we construct a high-quality error-correction dataset via reverse engineering to enhance spatial knowledge and improve the stability and controllability of layout generation, while reporting multi-dimensional evaluation metrics for further analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing commercial code agents (Cursor and Antigravity) and LLMs (Qwen3 and Gemini-3-Pro). in scene construction and narrative intent conveyance, providing a scalable solution for the democratization of environment creation.]]></description>

Reinforcement learning has empowered large language models to act as intelligent agents, yet training them for long-horizon tasks remains challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality trajectories, especially under limited resources. Existing methods typically scale up rollout sizes and indiscriminately allocate computational resources among intermediate steps. Such attempts inherently waste substantial computation budget on trivial steps while failing to guarantee sample quality. To address this, we propose Spark (Strategic Policy-Aware exploRation via Key-state dynamic branching), a novel framework that selectively branches at critical decision states for resource-efficient exploration. Our key insight is to activate adaptive branching exploration at critical decision points to probe promising trajectories, thereby achieving precise resource allocation that prioritizes sampling quality over blind coverage. This design leverages the agent's intrinsic decision-making signals to reduce dependence on human priors, enabling the agent to autonomously expand exploration and achieve stronger generalization. Experiments across diverse tasks (e.g., embodied planning), demonstrate that Spark achieves superior success rates with significantly fewer training samples, exhibiting robust generalization even in unseen scenarios.]]></description>

The rapid expansion of long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) has reignited debate on whether Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) remains necessary. However, empirical evidence reveals persistent limitations of long-context inference, including the lost-in-the-middle phenomenon, high computational cost, and poor scalability for multi-document reasoning. Conversely, traditional RAG systems, while efficient, are constrained by flat chunk-level retrieval that introduces semantic noise and fails to support structured cross-document synthesis.
  We present FABLE, a Forest-based Adaptive Bi-path LLM-Enhanced retrieval framework that integrates LLMs into both knowledge organization and retrieval. FABLE constructs LLM-enhanced hierarchical forest indexes with multi-granularity semantic structures, then employs a bi-path strategy combining LLM-guided hierarchical traversal with structure-aware propagation for fine-grained evidence acquisition, with explicit budget control for adaptive efficiency trade-offs.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that FABLE consistently outperforms SOTA RAG methods and achieves comparable accuracy to full-context LLM inference with up to 94\% token reduction, showing that long-context LLMs amplify rather than fully replace the need for structured retrieval.]]></description>

Large language models are increasingly post-trained with reinforcement learning in verifiable domains such as code and math. Yet, current methods for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) learn only from a scalar outcome reward per attempt, creating a severe credit-assignment bottleneck. Many verifiable environments actually provide rich textual feedback, such as runtime errors or judge evaluations, that explain why an attempt failed. We formalize this setting as reinforcement learning with rich feedback and introduce Self-Distillation Policy Optimization (SDPO), which converts tokenized feedback into a dense learning signal without any external teacher or explicit reward model. SDPO treats the current model conditioned on feedback as a self-teacher and distills its feedback-informed next-token predictions back into the policy. In this way, SDPO leverages the model's ability to retrospectively identify its own mistakes in-context. Across scientific reasoning, tool use, and competitive programming on LiveCodeBench v6, SDPO improves sample efficiency and final accuracy over strong RLVR baselines. Notably, SDPO also outperforms baselines in standard RLVR environments that only return scalar feedback by using successful rollouts as implicit feedback for failed attempts. Finally, applying SDPO to individual questions at test time accelerates discovery on difficult binary-reward tasks, achieving the same discovery probability as best-of-k sampling or multi-turn conversations with 3x fewer attempts.]]></description>

Open-weight coding agents should hold a fundamental advantage over closed-source systems: they can be specialized to private codebases, encoding repository-specific information directly in their weights. Yet the cost and complexity of training has kept this advantage theoretical. We show it is now practical. We present Soft-Verified Efficient Repository Agents (SERA), an efficient method for training coding agents that enables the rapid and cheap creation of agents specialized to private codebases. Using only supervised finetuning (SFT), SERA achieves state-of-the-art results among fully open-source (open data, method, code) models while matching the performance of frontier open-weight models like Devstral-Small-2. Creating SERA models is 26x cheaper than reinforcement learning and 57x cheaper than previous synthetic data methods to reach equivalent performance. Our method, Soft Verified Generation (SVG), generates thousands of trajectories from a single code repository. Combined with cost-efficiency, this enables specialization to private codebases. Beyond repository specialization, we apply SVG to a larger corpus of codebases, generating over 200,000 synthetic trajectories. We use this dataset to provide detailed analysis of scaling laws, ablations, and confounding factors for training coding agents. Overall, we believe our work will greatly accelerate research on open coding agents and showcase the advantage of open-source models that can specialize to private codebases. We release SERA as the first model in Ai2's Open Coding Agents series, along with all our code, data, and Claude Code integration to support the research community.]]></description>

Despite significant progress in alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that elicit harmful behaviors. Activation steering techniques offer a promising inference-time intervention approach, but existing methods suffer from critical limitations: activation addition requires careful coefficient tuning and is sensitive to layer-specific norm variations, while directional ablation provides only binary control. Recent work on Angular Steering introduces continuous control via rotation in a 2D subspace, but its practical implementation violates norm preservation, causing distribution shift and generation collapse, particularly in models below 7B parameters. We propose Selective Steering, which addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a mathematically rigorous norm-preserving rotation formulation that maintains activation distribution integrity, and (2) discriminative layer selection that applies steering only where feature representations exhibit opposite-signed class alignment. Experiments across nine models demonstrate that Selective Steering achieves 5.5x higher attack success rates than prior methods while maintaining zero perplexity violations and approximately 100\% capability retention on standard benchmarks. Our approach provides a principled, efficient framework for controllable and stable LLM behavior modification. Code: https://github.com/knoveleng/steering]]></description>

The space of task-agnostic feature upsampling has emerged as a promising area of research to efficiently create denser features from pre-trained visual backbones. These methods act as a shortcut to achieve dense features for a fraction of the cost by learning to map low-resolution features to high-resolution versions. While early works in this space used iterative upsampling approaches, more recent works have switched to cross-attention-based methods, which risk falling into the same efficiency scaling problems of the backbones they are upsampling. In this work, we demonstrate that iterative upsampling methods can still compete with cross-attention-based methods; moreover, they can achieve state-of-the-art performance with lower inference costs. We propose UPLiFT, an architecture for Universal Pixel-dense Lightweight Feature Transforms. We also propose an efficient Local Attender operator to overcome the limitations of prior iterative feature upsampling methods. This operator uses an alternative attentional pooling formulation defined fully locally. We show that our Local Attender allows UPLiFT to maintain stable features throughout upsampling, enabling state-of-the-art performance with lower inference costs than existing pixel-dense feature upsamplers. In addition, we apply UPLiFT to generative downstream tasks and show that it achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art Coupled Flow Matching models for VAE feature upsampling. Altogether, UPLiFT offers a versatile and efficient approach to creating denser features.]]></description>

Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) is increasingly bottlenecked by rollout (generation), where long output sequence lengths make attention and KV-cache memory dominate end-to-end step time. FP8 offers an attractive lever for accelerating RL by reducing compute cost and memory traffic during rollout, but applying FP8 in RL introduces unique engineering and algorithmic challenges: policy weights change every step (requiring repeated quantization and weight synchronization into the inference engine) and low-precision rollouts can deviate from the higher-precision policy assumed by the trainer, causing train-inference mismatch and potential instability. This report presents a practical FP8 rollout stack for LLM RL, implemented in the veRL ecosystem with support for common training backends (e.g., FSDP/Megatron-LM) and inference engines (e.g., vLLM/SGLang). We (i) enable FP8 W8A8 linear-layer rollout using blockwise FP8 quantization, (ii) extend FP8 to KV-cache to remove long-context memory bottlenecks via per-step QKV scale recalibration, and (iii) mitigate mismatch using importance-sampling-based rollout correction (token-level TIS/MIS variants). Across dense and MoE models, these techniques deliver up to 44% rollout throughput gains while preserving learning behavior comparable to BF16 baselines.]]></description>

Depth sensors are widely deployed across robotic platforms, and advances in fast, high-fidelity depth simulation have enabled robotic policies trained on depth observations to achieve robust sim-to-real transfer for a wide range of tasks. Despite this, representation learning for depth modality remains underexplored compared to RGB, where large-scale foundation models now define the state of the art. To address this gap, we present DeFM, a self-supervised foundation model trained entirely on depth images for robotic applications. Using a DINO-style self-distillation objective on a curated dataset of 60M depth images, DeFM learns geometric and semantic representations that generalize to diverse environments, tasks, and sensors. To retain metric awareness across multiple scales, we introduce a novel input normalization strategy. We further distill DeFM into compact models suitable for resource-constrained robotic systems. When evaluated on depth-based classification, segmentation, navigation, locomotion, and manipulation benchmarks, DeFM achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong generalization from simulation to real-world environments. We release all our pretrained models, which can be adopted off-the-shelf for depth-based robotic learning without task-specific fine-tuning. Webpage: https://de-fm.github.io/]]></description>

Long-context reasoning has significantly empowered large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex tasks, yet it introduces severe efficiency bottlenecks due to the computational complexity. Existing efficient approaches often rely on complex additional training or external models for compression, which limits scalability and discards critical fine-grained information. In this paper, we propose VTC-R1, a new efficient reasoning paradigm that integrates vision-text compression into the reasoning process. Instead of processing lengthy textual traces, VTC-R1 renders intermediate reasoning segments into compact images, which are iteratively fed back into vision-language models as "optical memory." We construct a training dataset based on OpenR1-Math-220K achieving 3.4x token compression and fine-tune representative VLMs-Glyph and Qwen3-VL. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as MATH500, AIME25, AMC23 and GPQA-D demonstrate that VTC-R1 consistently outperforms standard long-context reasoning. Furthermore, our approach significantly improves inference efficiency, achieving 2.7x speedup in end-to-end latency, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for reasoning-intensive applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/w-yibo/VTC-R1.]]></description>

Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) integrate both visual understanding and generation within a single framework. Their ultimate aspiration is to create a cycle where understanding and generation mutually reinforce each other. While recent post-training methods have successfully leveraged understanding to enhance generation, the reverse direction of utilizing generation to improve understanding remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose UniMRG (Unified Multi-Representation Generation), a simple yet effective architecture-agnostic post-training method. UniMRG enhances the understanding capabilities of UMMs by incorporating auxiliary generation tasks. Specifically, we train UMMs to generate multiple intrinsic representations of input images, namely pixel (reconstruction), depth (geometry), and segmentation (structure), alongside standard visual understanding objectives. By synthesizing these diverse representations, UMMs capture complementary information regarding appearance, spatial relations, and structural layout. Consequently, UMMs develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of visual inputs. Extensive experiments across diverse UMM architectures demonstrate that our method notably enhances fine-grained perception, reduces hallucinations, and improves spatial understanding, while simultaneously boosting generation capabilities.]]></description>

For socially sensitive tasks like hate speech detection, the quality of explanations from Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for factors like user trust and model alignment. While Persona prompting (PP) is increasingly used as a way to steer model towards user-specific generation, its effect on model rationales remains underexplored. We investigate how LLM-generated rationales vary when conditioned on different simulated demographic personas. Using datasets annotated with word-level rationales, we measure agreement with human annotations from different demographic groups, and assess the impact of PP on model bias and human alignment. Our evaluation across three LLMs results reveals three key findings: (1) PP improving classification on the most subjective task (hate speech) but degrading rationale quality. (2) Simulated personas fail to align with their real-world demographic counterparts, and high inter-persona agreement shows models are resistant to significant steering. (3) Models exhibit consistent demographic biases and a strong tendency to over-flag content as harmful, regardless of PP. Our findings reveal a critical trade-off: while PP can improve classification in socially-sensitive tasks, it often comes at the cost of rationale quality and fails to mitigate underlying biases, urging caution in its application.]]></description>

Sketching provides an intuitive way to convey dynamic intent in animation authoring (i.e., how elements change over time and space), making it a natural medium for automatic content creation. Yet existing approaches often constrain sketches to fixed command tokens or predefined visual forms, overlooking their freeform nature and the central role of humans in shaping intention. To address this, we introduce an interaction paradigm where users convey dynamic intent to a vision-language model via free-form sketching, instantiated here in a sketch storyboard to motion graphics workflow. We implement an interface and improve it through a three-stage study with 24 participants. The study shows how sketches convey motion with minimal input, how their inherent ambiguity requires users to be involved for clarification, and how sketches can visually guide video refinement. Our findings reveal the potential of sketch and AI interaction to bridge the gap between intention and outcome, and demonstrate its applicability to 3D animation and video generation.]]></description>

Language model representations often contain linear directions that correspond to high-level concepts. Here, we study the dynamics of these representations: how representations evolve along these dimensions within the context of (simulated) conversations. We find that linear representations can change dramatically over a conversation; for example, information that is represented as factual at the beginning of a conversation can be represented as non-factual at the end and vice versa. These changes are content-dependent; while representations of conversation-relevant information may change, generic information is generally preserved. These changes are robust even for dimensions that disentangle factuality from more superficial response patterns, and occur across different model families and layers of the model. These representation changes do not require on-policy conversations; even replaying a conversation script written by an entirely different model can produce similar changes. However, adaptation is much weaker from simply having a sci-fi story in context that is framed more explicitly as such. We also show that steering along a representational direction can have dramatically different effects at different points in a conversation. These results are consistent with the idea that representations may evolve in response to the model playing a particular role that is cued by a conversation. Our findings may pose challenges for interpretability and steering -- in particular, they imply that it may be misleading to use static interpretations of features or directions, or probes that assume a particular range of features consistently corresponds to a particular ground-truth value. However, these types of representational dynamics also point to exciting new research directions for understanding how models adapt to context.]]></description>

Recent progress in Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning is increasingly driven by the refinement of post-training loss functions and alignment strategies. However, standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) remain constrained by static uniformity: uniform prompt sampling and a fixed number of rollouts per prompt. For heterogeneous, heavy-tailed reasoning data, this creates structural inefficiencies that waste compute on already-solved patterns while under-training the long tail of hard problems. To address this, we propose Multi-Adversary Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GDRO), an optimization-first framework that moves beyond uniform reasoning models by dynamically adapting the training distribution.
  We introduce an Online Difficulty Classifier that partitions prompts into dynamic pass@k difficulty groups. We then propose two independent GDRO games for post-training: (1) Prompt-GDRO, which employs an EMA-debiased multiplicative-weights bandit sampler to target the intensive difficulty margin and upweight persistently hard groups without frequency bias; and (2) Rollout-GDRO, which uses a shadow-price controller to reallocate rollouts across groups, maximizing gradient variance reduction on hard tasks under a fixed mean budget (compute-neutral). We provide no-regret guarantees for both controllers and additionally a variance-proxy analysis motivating a square-root optimal rollout allocation for Rollout-GDRO. We validate our framework on the DAPO 14.1k dataset using Qwen3-Base models. Prompt-GDRO and Rollout-GDRO achieve average relative gains of +10.6% and +10.1%, respectively, in pass@8 accuracy across 1.7B, 4B, and 8B scales compared to the GRPO baseline. Qualitative analysis shows an emergent curriculum: the adversaries shift resources to the evolving reasoning frontier, enhancing the reasoning model's performance.]]></description>

Despite decades of research on reverberant speech, comparing methods remains difficult because most corpora lack per-file acoustic annotations or provide limited documentation for reproduction. We present RIR-Mega-Speech, a corpus of approximately 117.5 hours created by convolving LibriSpeech utterances with roughly 5,000 simulated room impulse responses from the RIR-Mega collection. Every file includes RT60, direct-to-reverberant ratio (DRR), and clarity index (C_{50}) computed from the source RIR using clearly defined, reproducible procedures. We also provide scripts to rebuild the dataset and reproduce all evaluation results.
  Using Whisper small on 1,500 paired utterances, we measure 5.20% WER (95% CI: 4.69--5.78) on clean speech and 7.70% (7.04--8.35) on reverberant versions, corresponding to a paired increase of 2.50 percentage points (2.06--2.98). This represents a 48% relative degradation. WER increases monotonically with RT60 and decreases with DRR, consistent with prior perceptual studies. While the core finding that reverberation harms recognition is well established, we aim to provide the community with a standardized resource where acoustic conditions are transparent and results can be verified independently. The repository includes one-command rebuild instructions for both Windows and Linux environments.]]></description>

Resolving team conflicts requires not only task-specific competence, but also social intelligence to find common ground and build consensus. As AI agents increasingly collaborate on complex work, they must develop coordination capabilities to function as effective teammates. Yet we hypothesize that current agents lack these capabilities. To test this, we introduce CooperBench, a benchmark of over 600 collaborative coding tasks across 12 libraries in 4 programming languages. Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination. Tasks are grounded in real open-source repositories with expert-written tests. Evaluating state-of-the-art coding agents, we observe the curse of coordination: agents achieve on average 30% lower success rates when working together compared to performing both tasks individually. This contrasts sharply with human teams, where adding teammates typically improves productivity. Our analysis reveals three key issues: (1) communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages; (2) even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments; and (3) agents often hold incorrect expectations about others' plans and communication. Through large-scale simulation, we also observe rare but interesting emergent coordination behavior including role division, resource division, and negotiation. Our research presents a novel benchmark for collaborative coding and calls for a shift from pursuing individual agent capability to developing social intelligence.]]></description>

Verilog's design cycle is inherently labor-intensive and necessitates extensive domain expertise. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising pathway toward automation, their limited training data and intrinsic sequential reasoning fail to capture the strict formal logic and concurrency inherent in hardware systems. To overcome these barriers, we present EvolVE, the first framework to analyze multiple evolution strategies on chip design tasks, revealing that Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) excels at maximizing functional correctness, while Idea-Guided Refinement (IGR) proves superior for optimization. We further leverage Structured Testbench Generation (STG) to accelerate the evolutionary process. To address the lack of complex optimization benchmarks, we introduce IC-RTL, targeting industry-scale problems derived from the National Integrated Circuit Contest. Evaluations establish EvolVE as the new state-of-the-art, achieving 98.1% on VerilogEval v2 and 92% on RTLLM v2. Furthermore, on the industry-scale IC-RTL suite, our framework surpasses reference implementations authored by contest participants, reducing the Power, Performance, Area (PPA) product by up to 66% in Huffman Coding and 17% in the geometric mean across all problems. The source code of the IC-RTL benchmark is available at https://github.com/weiber2002/ICRTL.]]></description>

Aiming at efficient and dense chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, latent reasoning methods fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) to substitute discrete language tokens with continuous latent tokens. These methods consume fewer tokens compared to the conventional language CoT reasoning and have the potential to plan in a dense latent space. However, current latent tokens are generally supervised based on imitating language labels. Considering that there can be multiple equivalent but diverse CoT labels for a question, passively imitating an arbitrary one may lead to inferior latent token representations and latent reasoning policies, undermining the potential planning ability and resulting in clear gaps between training and testing. In this work, we emphasize the importance of active planning over the representation space of latent tokens in achieving the optimal latent reasoning policy. So, we propose the Active Latent Planning method (ATP-Latent), which models the supervision process of latent tokens as a conditional variational auto-encoder (VAE) to obtain a smoother latent space. Moreover, to facilitate the most reasonable latent reasoning policy, ATP-Latent conducts reinforcement learning (RL) with an auxiliary coherence reward, which is calculated based on the consistency between VAE-decoded contents of latent tokens, enabling a guided RL process. In experiments on LLaMA-1B, ATP-Latent demonstrates +4.1\% accuracy and -3.3\% tokens on four benchmarks compared to advanced baselines. Codes are available on https://github.com/zz1358m/ATP-Latent-master.]]></description>

Speaker-attributed automatic speech recognition (ASR) in multi-speaker environments remains a major challenge. While some approaches achieve strong performance when fine-tuned on specific domains, few systems generalize well across out-of-domain datasets. Our prior work, Diarization-Conditioned Whisper (DiCoW), leverages speaker diarization outputs as conditioning information and, with minimal fine-tuning, demonstrated strong multilingual and multi-domain performance. In this paper, we address a key limitation of DiCoW: ambiguity in Silence-Target-Non-target-Overlap (STNO) masks, where two or more fully overlapping speakers may have nearly identical conditioning despite differing transcriptions. We introduce SE-DiCoW (Self-Enrolled Diarization-Conditioned Whisper), which uses diarization output to locate an enrollment segment anywhere in the conversation where the target speaker is most active. This enrollment segment is used as fixed conditioning via cross-attention at each encoder layer. We further refine DiCoW with improved data segmentation, model initialization, and augmentation. Together, these advances yield substantial gains: SE-DiCoW reduces macro-averaged tcpWER by 52.4% relative to the original DiCoW on the EMMA MT-ASR benchmark.]]></description>

Multimodal sarcasm detection (MSD) aims to identify sarcasm within image-text pairs by modeling semantic incongruities across modalities. Existing methods often exploit cross-modal embedding misalignment to detect inconsistency but struggle when visual and textual content are loosely related or semantically indirect. While recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate sarcastic cues, the inherent diversity and subjectivity of these generations often introduce noise. To address these limitations, we propose the Generative Discrepancy Comparison Network (GDCNet). This framework captures cross-modal conflicts by utilizing descriptive, factually grounded image captions generated by Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as stable semantic anchors. Specifically, GDCNet computes semantic and sentiment discrepancies between the generated objective description and the original text, alongside measuring visual-textual fidelity. These discrepancy features are then fused with visual and textual representations via a gated module to adaptively balance modality contributions. Extensive experiments on MSD benchmarks demonstrate GDCNet's superior accuracy and robustness, establishing a new state-of-the-art on the MMSD2.0 benchmark.]]></description>

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) govern diverse physiological processes and are central to modern pharmacology. Yet discovering GPCR modulators remains challenging because receptor activation often arises from complex allosteric effects rather than direct binding affinity, and conventional assays are slow, costly, and not optimized for capturing these dynamics. Here we present GPCR-Filter, a deep learning framework specifically developed for GPCR modulator discovery. We assembled a high-quality dataset of over 90,000 experimentally validated GPCR-ligand pairs, providing a robust foundation for training and evaluation. GPCR-Filter integrates the ESM-3 protein language model for high-fidelity GPCR sequence representations with graph neural networks that encode ligand structures, coupled through an attention-based fusion mechanism that learns receptor-ligand functional relationships. Across multiple evaluation settings, GPCR-Filter consistently outperforms state-of-the-art compound-protein interaction models and exhibits strong generalization to unseen receptors and ligands. Notably, the model successfully identified micromolar-level agonists of the 5-HT1A receptor with distinct chemical frameworks. These results establish GPCR-Filter as a scalable and effective computational approach for GPCR modulator discovery, advancing AI-assisted drug development for complex signaling systems.]]></description>

We present Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning, the first open-source native reasoning model for cybersecurity. Built upon our previously released Foundation-Sec-8B base model (derived from Llama-3.1-8B-Base), the model is trained through a two-stage process combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR). Our training leverages proprietary reasoning data spanning cybersecurity analysis, instruction-following, and mathematical reasoning. Evaluation across 10 cybersecurity benchmarks and 10 general-purpose benchmarks demonstrates performance competitive with significantly larger models on cybersecurity tasks while maintaining strong general capabilities. The model shows effective generalization on multi-hop reasoning tasks and strong safety performance when deployed with appropriate system prompts and guardrails. This work demonstrates that domain-specialized reasoning models can achieve strong performance on specialized tasks while maintaining broad general capabilities. We release the model publicly at https://huggingface.co/fdtn-ai/Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning.]]></description>

The growing demand for real-time robotic deployment necessitates fast and on-device inference for vision-language-action (VLA) models. Within the VLA literature, efficiency has been extensively studied at the token level, such as visual token pruning. In contrast, systematic transformer layer reduction has received limited attention and, to the best of our knowledge, has not been explored for flow-based VLA models under knowledge distillation. In this work, we propose Shallow-pi, a principled knowledge distillation framework that aggressively reduces the transformer depth of both the VLM backbone and the flow-based action head, compressing the model from 18 to 6 layers. Shallow-pi achieves over two times faster inference with less than one percent absolute drop in success rate on standard manipulation benchmarks, establishing state-of-the-art performance among reduced VLA models. Crucially, we validate our approach through industrial-scale real-world experiments on Jetson Orin and Jetson Thor across multiple robot platforms, including humanoid systems, in complex and dynamic manipulation scenarios.]]></description>

Recently, we have often observed hallucinated citations or references that do not correspond to any existing work in papers under review, preprints, or published papers. Such hallucinated citations pose a serious concern to scientific reliability. When they appear in accepted papers, they may also negatively affect the credibility of conferences. In this study, we refer to hallucinated citations as "HalluCitation" and systematically investigate their prevalence and impact. We analyze all papers published at ACL, NAACL, and EMNLP in 2024 and 2025, including main conference, Findings, and workshop papers. Our analysis reveals that nearly 300 papers contain at least one HalluCitation, most of which were published in 2025. Notably, half of these papers were identified at EMNLP 2025, the most recent conference, indicating that this issue is rapidly increasing. Moreover, more than 100 such papers were accepted as main conference and Findings papers at EMNLP 2025, affecting the credibility.]]></description>

Modern data parallel (DP) training favors collective communication over parameter servers (PS) for its simplicity and efficiency under balanced workloads. However, the balanced workload assumption no longer holds in large language model (LLM) post-training due to the high variance in sequence lengths. Under imbalanced workloads, collective communication creates synchronization barriers, leading to under-utilization of devices with smaller workloads. This change in training dynamics calls for a revisit of the PS paradigm for its robustness to such imbalance. We propose On-Demand Communication (ODC), which adapts PS into Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) by replacing collective all-gather and reduce-scatter with direct point-to-point communication. Compared to FSDP, ODC reduces the synchronization barrier from once per layer to once per minibatch and decouples the workload on each device so that faster workers are not stalled. It also enables simpler and more effective load balancing at the minibatch level. Across diverse LLM post-training tasks, ODC consistently improves device utilization and training throughput, achieving up to a 36\% speedup over standard FSDP. These results demonstrate that ODC is a superior fit for the prevalent imbalanced workloads in LLM post-training. Our implementation of ODC and integration with FSDP is open-sourced at https://github.com/sail-sg/odc.]]></description>

While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language-based agentic tasks, their applicability to unseen, nonlinguistic environments (e.g., symbolic or spatial tasks) remains limited. Previous work attributes this performance gap to the mismatch between the pretraining distribution and the testing distribution. In this work, we demonstrate the primary bottleneck is the prohibitive cost of exploration: mastering these tasks requires extensive trial-and-error, which is computationally unsustainable for parameter-heavy LLMs operating in a high dimensional semantic space. To address this, we propose SCOUT (Sub-Scale Collaboration On Unseen Tasks), a novel framework that decouples exploration from exploitation. We employ lightweight "scouts" (e.g., small MLPs) to probe environmental dynamics at a speed and scale far exceeding LLMs. The collected trajectories are utilized to bootstrap the LLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by multi-turn Reinforcement Learning (RL) to activate its latent world knowledge. Empirically, SCOUT enables a Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model to achieve an average score of 0.86, significantly outperforming proprietary models, including Gemini-2.5-Pro (0.60), while saving about 60% GPU hours consumption.]]></description>

Cybersecurity operations demand assistant LLMs that support diverse workflows without exposing sensitive data. Existing solutions either rely on proprietary APIs with privacy risks or on open models lacking domain adaptation. To bridge this gap, we curate 11.8B tokens of cybersecurity-focused continual pretraining data via large-scale web filtering and manual collection of high-quality resources, spanning 28.6K documents across frameworks, offensive techniques, and security tools. Building on this, we design an agentic augmentation pipeline that simulates expert workflows to generate 266K multi-turn cybersecurity samples for supervised fine-tuning. Combined with general open-source LLM data, these resources enable the training of RedSage, an open-source, locally deployable cybersecurity assistant with domain-aware pretraining and post-training. To rigorously evaluate the models, we introduce RedSage-Bench, a benchmark with 30K multiple-choice and 240 open-ended Q&A items covering cybersecurity knowledge, skills, and tool expertise. RedSage is further evaluated on established cybersecurity benchmarks (e.g., CTI-Bench, CyberMetric, SECURE) and general LLM benchmarks to assess broader generalization. At the 8B scale, RedSage achieves consistently better results, surpassing the baseline models by up to +5.59 points on cybersecurity benchmarks and +5.05 points on Open LLM Leaderboard tasks. These findings demonstrate that domain-aware agentic augmentation and pre/post-training can not only enhance cybersecurity-specific expertise but also help to improve general reasoning and instruction-following. All models, datasets, and code are publicly available.]]></description>

Modern diffusion/flow-based models for image generation typically exhibit two core characteristics: (i) using multi-step sampling, and (ii) operating in a latent space. Recent advances have made encouraging progress on each aspect individually, paving the way toward one-step diffusion/flow without latents. In this work, we take a further step towards this goal and propose "pixel MeanFlow" (pMF). Our core guideline is to formulate the network output space and the loss space separately. The network target is designed to be on a presumed low-dimensional image manifold (i.e., x-prediction), while the loss is defined via MeanFlow in the velocity space. We introduce a simple transformation between the image manifold and the average velocity field. In experiments, pMF achieves strong results for one-step latent-free generation on ImageNet at 256x256 resolution (2.22 FID) and 512x512 resolution (2.48 FID), filling a key missing piece in this regime. We hope that our study will further advance the boundaries of diffusion/flow-based generative models.]]></description>

Public repositories host millions of fine-tuned models, yet community usage remains disproportionately concentrated on a small number of foundation checkpoints. We investigate whether this concentration reflects efficient market selection or if superior models are systematically overlooked. Through an extensive evaluation of over 2,000 models, we show the prevalence of "hidden gems", unpopular fine-tunes that significantly outperform their popular counterparts. Notably, within the Llama-3.1-8B family, we find rarely downloaded checkpoints that improve math performance from 83.2% to 96.0% without increasing inference costs. However, discovering these models through exhaustive evaluation of every uploaded model is computationally infeasible. We therefore formulate model discovery as a Multi-Armed Bandit problem and accelerate the Sequential Halving search algorithm by using shared query sets and aggressive elimination schedules. Our method retrieves top models with as few as 50 queries per candidate, accelerating discovery by over 50x.]]></description>

Hybrid Transformer architectures, which combine softmax attention blocks and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have shown a desirable performance-throughput tradeoff for long-context modeling, but their adoption and studies are hindered by the prohibitive cost of large-scale pre-training from scratch. Some recent studies have shown that pre-trained softmax attention blocks can be converted into RNN blocks through parameter transfer and knowledge distillation. However, these transfer methods require substantial amounts of training data (more than 10B tokens), and the resulting hybrid models also exhibit poor long-context performance, which is the scenario where hybrid models enjoy significant inference speedups over Transformer-based models. In this paper, we present HALO (Hybrid Attention via Layer Optimization), a pipeline for distilling Transformer models into RNN-attention hybrid models. We then present HypeNet, a hybrid architecture with superior length generalization enabled by a novel position encoding scheme (named HyPE) and various architectural modifications. We convert the Qwen3 series into HypeNet using HALO, achieving performance comparable to the original Transformer models while enjoying superior long-context performance and efficiency. The conversion requires just 2.3B tokens, less than 0.01% of their pre-training data]]></description>

We introduce UEval, a benchmark to evaluate unified models, i.e., models capable of generating both images and text. UEval comprises 1,000 expert-curated questions that require both images and text in the model output, sourced from 8 real-world tasks. Our curated questions cover a wide range of reasoning types, from step-by-step guides to textbook explanations. Evaluating open-ended multimodal generation is non-trivial, as simple LLM-as-a-judge methods can miss the subtleties. Different from previous works that rely on multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to rate image quality or text accuracy, we design a rubric-based scoring system in UEval. For each question, reference images and text answers are provided to a MLLM to generate an initial rubric, consisting of multiple evaluation criteria, and human experts then refine and validate these rubrics. In total, UEval contains 10,417 validated rubric criteria, enabling scalable and fine-grained automatic scoring. UEval is challenging for current unified models: GPT-5-Thinking scores only 66.4 out of 100, while the best open-source model reaches merely 49.1. We observe that reasoning models often outperform non-reasoning ones, and transferring reasoning traces from a reasoning model to a non-reasoning model significantly narrows the gap. This suggests that reasoning may be important for tasks requiring complex multimodal understanding and generation.]]></description>

Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has achieved notable success in enabling agents to perform complex reasoning and tool use. However, most methods still relies on sparse outcome-based reward for training. Such feedback fails to differentiate intermediate reasoning quality, leading to suboptimal training results. In this paper, we introduce Agent Reasoning Reward Model (Agent-RRM), a multi-faceted reward model that produces structured feedback for agentic trajectories, including (1) an explicit reasoning trace , (2) a focused critique that provides refinement guidance by highlighting reasoning flaws, and (3) an overall score that evaluates process performance. Leveraging these signals, we systematically investigate three integration strategies: Reagent-C (text-augmented refinement), Reagent-R (reward-augmented guidance), and Reagent-U (unified feedback integration). Extensive evaluations across 12 diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Reagent-U yields substantial performance leaps, achieving 43.7% on GAIA and 46.2% on WebWalkerQA, validating the effectiveness of our reasoning reward model and training schemes. Code, models, and datasets are all released to facilitate future research.]]></description>

Manipulating dynamic objects remains an open challenge for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which, despite strong generalization in static manipulation, struggle in dynamic scenarios requiring rapid perception, temporal anticipation, and continuous control. We present DynamicVLA, a framework for dynamic object manipulation that integrates temporal reasoning and closed-loop adaptation through three key designs: 1) a compact 0.4B VLA using a convolutional vision encoder for spatially efficient, structurally faithful encoding, enabling fast multimodal inference; 2) Continuous Inference, enabling overlapping reasoning and execution for lower latency and timely adaptation to object motion; and 3) Latent-aware Action Streaming, which bridges the perception-execution gap by enforcing temporally aligned action execution. To fill the missing foundation of dynamic manipulation data, we introduce the Dynamic Object Manipulation (DOM) benchmark, built from scratch with an auto data collection pipeline that efficiently gathers 200K synthetic episodes across 2.8K scenes and 206 objects, and enables fast collection of 2K real-world episodes without teleoperation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate remarkable improvements in response speed, perception, and generalization, positioning DynamicVLA as a unified framework for general dynamic object manipulation across embodiments.]]></description>

Neural networks have been successfully applied in various resource-constrained edge devices, where usually central processing units (CPUs) instead of graphics processing units exist due to limited power availability. State-of-the-art research still focuses on efficiently executing enormous numbers of multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. However, CPUs themselves are not good at executing such mathematical operations on a large scale, since they are more suited to execute control flow logic, i.e., computer algorithms. To enhance the computation efficiency of neural networks on CPUs, in this paper, we propose to convert them into logic flows for execution. Specifically, neural networks are first converted into equivalent decision trees, from which decision paths with constant leaves are then selected and compressed into logic flows. Such logic flows consist of if and else structures and a reduced number of MAC operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the latency can be reduced by up to 14.9 % on a simulated RISC-V CPU without any accuracy degradation.

Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often answer classic visual illusions "correctly" on original images, yet persist with the same responses when illusion factors are inverted, even though the visual change is obvious to humans. This raises a fundamental question: do VLMs perceive visual changes or merely recall memorized patterns? While several studies have noted this phenomenon, the underlying causes remain unclear. To move from observations to systematic understanding, this paper introduces VI-Probe, a controllable visual-illusion framework with graded perturbations and matched visual controls (without illusion inducer) that disentangles visually grounded perception from language-driven recall. Unlike prior work that focuses on averaged accuracy, we measure stability and sensitivity using Polarity-Flip Consistency, Template Fixation Index, and an illusion multiplier normalized against matched controls. Experiments across different families reveal that response persistence arises from heterogeneous causes rather than a single mechanism. For instance, GPT-5 exhibits memory override, Claude-Opus-4.1 shows perception-memory competition, while Qwen variants suggest visual-processing limits. Our findings challenge single-cause views and motivate probing-based evaluation that measures both knowledge and sensitivity to controlled visual change.

The development of autonomous web agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL), represents a significant step towards general-purpose AI assistants. However, training these agents is severely hampered by the challenges of interacting with the live internet, which is inefficient, costly, and fraught with risks. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) offers a promising solution by learning a world model of the environment to enable simulated interaction. This paper introduces DynaWeb, a novel MBRL framework that trains web agents through interacting with a web world model trained to predict naturalistic web page representations given agent actions. This model serves as a synthetic web environment where an agent policy can dream by generating vast quantities of rollout action trajectories for efficient online reinforcement learning. Beyond free policy rollouts, DynaWeb incorporates real expert trajectories from training data, which are randomly interleaved with on-policy rollouts during training to improve stability and sample efficiency. Experiments conducted on the challenging WebArena and WebVoyager benchmarks demonstrate that DynaWeb consistently and significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art open-source web agent models. Our findings establish the viability of training web agents through imagination, offering a scalable and efficient way to scale up online agentic RL.]]></description>

Due to limited supervised training data, large language models (LLMs) are typically pre-trained via a self-supervised "predict the next word" objective on a vast amount of unstructured text data. To make the resulting model useful to users, it is further trained on a far smaller amount of "instruction-tuning" data comprised of supervised training examples of instructions and responses. To overcome the limited amount of supervised data, we propose a procedure that can transform the knowledge in internet-scale pre-training documents into billions of synthetic instruction and answer training pairs. The resulting dataset, called FineInstructions, uses ~18M instruction templates created from real user-written queries and prompts. These instruction templates are matched to and instantiated with human-written source documents from unstructured pre-training corpora. With "supervised" synthetic training data generated at this scale, an LLM can be pre-trained from scratch solely with the instruction-tuning objective, which is far more in-distribution with the expected downstream usage of LLMs (responding to user prompts). We conduct controlled token-for-token training experiments and find pre-training on FineInstructions outperforms standard pre-training and other proposed synthetic pre-training techniques on standard benchmarks measuring free-form response quality.

Audio-Visual Foundation Models, which are pretrained to jointly generate sound and visual content, have recently shown an unprecedented ability to model multi-modal generation and editing, opening new opportunities for downstream tasks. Among these tasks, video dubbing could greatly benefit from such priors, yet most existing solutions still rely on complex, task-specific pipelines that struggle in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a single-model approach that adapts a foundational audio-video diffusion model for video-to-video dubbing via a lightweight LoRA. The LoRA enables the model to condition on an input audio-video while jointly generating translated audio and synchronized facial motion. To train this LoRA, we leverage the generative model itself to synthesize paired multilingual videos of the same speaker. Specifically, we generate multilingual videos with language switches within a single clip, and then inpaint the face and audio in each half to match the language of the other half. By leveraging the rich generative prior of the audio-visual model, our approach preserves speaker identity and lip synchronization while remaining robust to complex motion and real-world dynamics. We demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality dubbed videos with improved visual fidelity, lip synchronization, and robustness compared to existing dubbing pipelines.]]></description>

In pruning, the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that large networks contain sparse subnetworks, or winning tickets, that can be trained in isolation to match the performance of their dense counterparts. However, most existing approaches assume a single universal winning ticket shared across all inputs, ignoring the inherent heterogeneity of real-world data. In this work, we propose Routing the Lottery (RTL), an adaptive pruning framework that discovers multiple specialized subnetworks, called adaptive tickets, each tailored to a class, semantic cluster, or environmental condition. Across diverse datasets and tasks, RTL consistently outperforms single- and multi-model baselines in balanced accuracy and recall, while using up to 10 times fewer parameters than independent models and exhibiting semantically aligned. Furthermore, we identify subnetwork collapse, a performance drop under aggressive pruning, and introduce a subnetwork similarity score that enables label-free diagnosis of oversparsification. Overall, our results recast pruning as a mechanism for aligning model structure with data heterogeneity, paving the way toward more modular and context-aware deep learning.]]></description>

Reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, yet they remain fundamentally limited by a \emph{blind self-thinking} paradigm: performing extensive internal reasoning even when critical information is missing or ambiguous. We propose Proactive Interactive Reasoning (PIR), a new reasoning paradigm that transforms LLMs from passive solvers into proactive inquirers that interleave reasoning with clarification. Unlike existing search- or tool-based frameworks that primarily address knowledge uncertainty by querying external environments, PIR targets premise- and intent-level uncertainty through direct interaction with the user. PIR is implemented via two core components: (1) an uncertainty-aware supervised fine-tuning procedure that equips models with interactive reasoning capability, and (2) a user-simulator-based policy optimization framework driven by a composite reward that aligns model behavior with user intent. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning, code generation, and document editing demonstrate that PIR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 32.70\% higher accuracy, 22.90\% higher pass rate, and 41.36 BLEU improvement, while reducing nearly half of the reasoning computation and unnecessary interaction turns. Further reliability evaluations on factual knowledge, question answering, and missing-premise scenarios confirm the strong generalization and robustness of PIR.

Matrix functions such as square root, inverse roots, and orthogonalization play a central role in preconditioned gradient methods for neural network training. This has motivated the development of iterative algorithms that avoid explicit eigendecompositions and rely primarily on matrix multiplications, making them well suited for modern GPU accelerators. We present PRISM (Polynomial-fitting and Randomized Iterative Sketching for Matrix functions computation), a general framework for accelerating iterative algorithms for computing matrix functions. PRISM combines adaptive polynomial approximation with randomized sketching: at each iteration, it fits a polynomial surrogate to the current spectrum via a sketched least-squares problem, adapting to the instance at hand with minimal overhead. We apply PRISM to accelerate Newton-Schulz-like iterations for matrix square roots and orthogonalization, which are core primitives in machine learning. Unlike prior methods, PRISM requires no explicit spectral bounds or singular value estimates; and it adapts automatically to the evolving spectrum. Empirically, PRISM accelerates training when integrated into Shampoo and Muon optimizers.]]></description>

Existing agent safety benchmarks report binary accuracy, conflating early intervention with post-mortem analysis. A detector that flags a violation at step 8 enables intervention; one that reports it at step 48 provides only forensic value. This distinction is critical, yet current benchmarks cannot measure it. We introduce StepShield, the first benchmark to evaluate when violations are detected, not just whether. StepShield contains 9,213 code agent trajectories, including 1,278 meticulously annotated training pairs and a 7,935-trajectory test set with a realistic 8.1% rogue rate. Rogue behaviors are grounded in real-world security incidents across six categories. We propose three novel temporal metrics: Early Intervention Rate (EIR), Intervention Gap, and Tokens Saved. Surprisingly, our evaluation reveals that an LLM-based judge achieves 59% EIR while a static analyzer achieves only 26%, a 2.3x performance gap that is entirely invisible to standard accuracy metrics. We further show that early detection has direct economic benefits: our cascaded HybridGuard detector reduces monitoring costs by 75% and projects to $108M in cumulative savings over five years at enterprise scale. By shifting the focus of evaluation from whether to when, StepShield provides a new foundation for building safer and more economically viable AI agents. The code and data are released under an Apache 2.0 license.]]></description>

Full-image relighting remains a challenging problem due to the difficulty of collecting large-scale structured paired data, the difficulty of maintaining physical plausibility, and the limited generalizability imposed by data-driven priors. Existing attempts to bridge the synthetic-to-real gap for full-scene relighting remain suboptimal. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Physics-Inspired diffusion for full-image reLight ($π$-Light, or PI-Light), a two-stage framework that leverages physics-inspired diffusion models. Our design incorporates (i) batch-aware attention, which improves the consistency of intrinsic predictions across a collection of images, (ii) a physics-guided neural rendering module that enforces physically plausible light transport, (iii) physics-inspired losses that regularize training dynamics toward a physically meaningful landscape, thereby enhancing generalizability to real-world image editing, and (iv) a carefully curated dataset of diverse objects and scenes captured under controlled lighting conditions. Together, these components enable efficient finetuning of pretrained diffusion models while also providing a solid benchmark for downstream evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that $π$-Light synthesizes specular highlights and diffuse reflections across a wide variety of materials, achieving superior generalization to real-world scenes compared with prior approaches.]]></description>

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the deadliest solid malignancies, is often detected at a late and inoperable stage. Retrospective reviews of prediagnostic CT scans, when conducted by expert radiologists aware that the patient later developed PDAC, frequently reveal lesions that were previously overlooked. To help detecting these lesions earlier, we developed an automated system named ePAI (early Pancreatic cancer detection with Artificial Intelligence). It was trained on data from 1,598 patients from a single medical center. In the internal test involving 1,009 patients, ePAI achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.939-0.999, a sensitivity of 95.3%, and a specificity of 98.7% for detecting small PDAC less than 2 cm in diameter, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 2 mm. In an external test involving 7,158 patients across 6 centers, ePAI achieved an AUC of 0.918-0.945, a sensitivity of 91.5%, and a specificity of 88.0%, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 5 mm. Importantly, ePAI detected PDACs on prediagnostic CT scans obtained 3 to 36 months before clinical diagnosis that had originally been overlooked by radiologists. It successfully detected and localized PDACs in 75 of 159 patients, with a median lead time of 347 days before clinical diagnosis. Our multi-reader study showed that ePAI significantly outperformed 30 board-certified radiologists by 50.3% (P < 0.05) in sensitivity while maintaining a comparable specificity of 95.4% in detecting PDACs early and prediagnostic. These findings suggest its potential of ePAI as an assistive tool to improve early detection of pancreatic cancer.]]></description>

Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver state-of-the-art performance on complex reasoning tasks, but their inference costs limit deployment at scale. Small Language Models (SLMs) offer dramatic cost savings yet lag substantially in accuracy. Existing approaches - routing and cascading - treat the LLM as an all-or-nothing resource: either the query bypasses the LLM entirely, or the LLM generates a complete response at full cost. We introduce LLM Shepherding, a framework that requests only a short prefix (a hint) from the LLM and provides it to SLM. This simple mechanism is surprisingly effective for math and coding tasks: even hints comprising 10-30% of the full LLM response improve SLM accuracy significantly. Shepherding generalizes both routing and cascading, and it achieves lower cost under oracle decision-making. We develop a two-stage predictor that jointly determines whether a hint is needed and how many tokens to request. On the widely-used mathematical reasoning (GSM8K, CNK12) and code generation (HumanEval, MBPP) benchmarks, Shepherding reduces costs by 42-94% relative to LLM-only inference. Compared to state-of-the-art routing and cascading baselines, shepherding delivers up to 2.8x cost reduction while matching accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to exploit token-level budget control for SLM-LLM collaboration.]]></description>

Multi-objective optimization aims to solve problems with competing objectives, often with only black-box access to a problem and a limited budget of measurements. In many applications, historical data from related optimization tasks is available, creating an opportunity for meta-learning to accelerate the optimization. Bayesian optimization, as a promising technique for black-box optimization, has been extended to meta-learning and multi-objective optimization independently, but methods that simultaneously address both settings - meta-learned priors for multi-objective Bayesian optimization - remain largely unexplored. We propose SMOG, a scalable and modular meta-learning model based on a multi-output Gaussian process that explicitly learns correlations between objectives. SMOG builds a structured joint Gaussian process prior across meta- and target tasks and, after conditioning on metadata, yields a closed-form target-task prior augmented by a flexible residual multi-output kernel. This construction propagates metadata uncertainty into the target surrogate in a principled way. SMOG supports hierarchical, parallel training: meta-task Gaussian processes are fit once and then cached, achieving linear scaling with the number of meta-tasks. The resulting surrogate integrates seamlessly with standard multi-objective Bayesian optimization acquisition functions.]]></description>

Frontier large language models (LLMs) excel as autonomous agents in many domains, yet they remain untested in complex enterprise systems where hidden workflows create cascading effects across interconnected databases. Existing enterprise benchmarks evaluate surface-level agentic task completion similar to general consumer benchmarks, ignoring true challenges in enterprises, such as limited observability, large database state, and hidden workflows with cascading side effects. We introduce World of Workflows (WoW), a realistic ServiceNow-based environment incorporating 4,000+ business rules and 55 active workflows embedded in the system, alongside WoW-bench, a benchmark of 234 tasks evaluating constrained agentic task completion and enterprise dynamics modeling capabilities. We reveal two major takeaways: (1) Frontier LLMs suffer from dynamics blindness, consistently failing to predict the invisible, cascading side effects of their actions, which leads to silent constraint violations, and (2) reliability in opaque systems requires grounded world modeling, where agents must mentally simulate hidden state transitions to bridge the observability gap when high-fidelity feedback is unavailable. For reliable and useful enterprise agents, WoW motivates a new paradigm to explicitly learn system dynamics. We release our GitHub for setting up and evaluating WoW.]]></description>

Test-time scaling has been widely adopted to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, the standard approach of repeatedly sampling trajectories from scratch is computationally expensive. While recent methods have attempted to mitigate costs using specialized value agents, they can suffer from model miscalibration and fail to generalize to modern agents that synthesize custom bash scripts as tools. In this paper, we introduce SWE-Replay, the first efficient and generalizable test-time scaling technique for modern agents without reliance on potentially noisy value estimates. SWE-Replay optimizes the scaling process by recycling trajectories from prior trials, dynamically choosing to either explore from scratch or exploit archived experience by branching at critical intermediate steps. This selection of intermediate steps is driven by the potential and reasoning significance of repository exploration, rather than external LLM-based quality estimates. Our evaluation shows that, on SWE-Bench Verified, SWE-Replay consistently outperforms naive scaling, reducing costs by up to 17.4% while maintaining or even improving performance by up to 3.8%. Further evaluation on SWE-Bench Pro and Multilingual validates the generalizability of SWE-Replay, establishing it as a robust foundation for efficient test-time scaling of software engineering agents.]]></description>

Large language models (LLMs) trained with next-word-prediction have achieved success as clinical foundation models. Representations from these language backbones yield strong linear probe performance across biomedical tasks, suggesting that patient semantics emerge from next-token prediction at scale. However, this paradigm treats patients as a document to be summarized rather than a dynamical system to be simulated; a patient's trajectory emerges from their state evolving under interventions and time, requiring models that simulate dynamics rather than predict tokens. To address this, we introduce SMB-Structure, a world model for structured EHR that grounds a joint-embedding prediction architecture (JEPA) with next-token prediction (SFT). SFT grounds our model to reconstruct future patient states in token space, while JEPA predicts those futures in latent space from the initial patient representation alone, forcing trajectory dynamics to be encoded before the next state is observed. We validate across two large-scale cohorts: Memorial Sloan Kettering (23,319 oncology patients; 323,000+ patient-years) and INSPECT (19,402 pulmonary embolism patients). Using a linear probe evaluated at multiple points along the disease trajectory, we demonstrate that our training paradigm learns embeddings that capture disease dynamics not recoverable by autoregressive baselines, enabling SMB-Structure to achieve competitive performance on complex tasks characterized by high patient heterogeneity. Model weights are available at https://huggingface.co/standardmodelbio/SMB-v1-1.7B-Structure.]]></description>

Current generative video models excel at producing novel content from text and image prompts, but leave a critical gap in editing existing pre-recorded videos, where minor alterations to the spoken script require preserving motion, temporal coherence, speaker identity, and accurate lip synchronization. We introduce EditYourself, a DiT-based framework for audio-driven video-to-video (V2V) editing that enables transcript-based modification of talking head videos, including the seamless addition, removal, and retiming of visually spoken content. Building on a general-purpose video diffusion model, EditYourself augments its V2V capabilities with audio conditioning and region-aware, edit-focused training extensions. This enables precise lip synchronization and temporally coherent restructuring of existing performances via spatiotemporal inpainting, including the synthesis of realistic human motion in newly added segments, while maintaining visual fidelity and identity consistency over long durations. This work represents a foundational step toward generative video models as practical tools for professional video post-production.]]></description>

Creative image generation has emerged as a compelling area of research, driven by the need to produce novel and high-quality images that expand the boundaries of imagination. In this work, we propose a novel framework for creative generation using diffusion models, where creativity is associated with the inverse probability of an image's existence in the CLIP embedding space. Unlike prior approaches that rely on a manual blending of concepts or exclusion of subcategories, our method calculates the probability distribution of generated images and drives it towards low-probability regions to produce rare, imaginative, and visually captivating outputs. We also introduce pullback mechanisms, achieving high creativity without sacrificing visual fidelity. Extensive experiments on text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our creative generation framework, showcasing its ability to produce unique, novel, and thought-provoking images. This work provides a new perspective on creativity in generative models, offering a principled method to foster innovation in visual content synthesis.]]></description>

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on medical benchmarks, including question answering and diagnosis. To enable their use in clinical settings, LLMs are typically further adapted through continued pretraining or post-training using clinical data. However, most medical LLMs are trained on data from a single institution, which faces limitations in generalizability and safety in heterogeneous systems. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution for enabling collaborative model development across healthcare institutions. Yet applying FL to LLMs in medicine remains fundamentally limited. First, conventional FL requires transmitting the full model during each communication round, which becomes impractical for multi-billion-parameter LLMs given the limited computational resources. Second, many FL algorithms implicitly assume data homogeneity, whereas real-world clinical data are highly heterogeneous across patients, diseases, and institutional practices. We introduce the model-agnostic and parameter-efficient federated learning framework for adapting LLMs to medical applications. Fed-MedLoRA transmits only low-rank adapter parameters, reducing communication and computation overhead, while Fed-MedLoRA+ further incorporates adaptive, data-aware aggregation to improve convergence under cross-site heterogeneity. We apply the framework to clinical information extraction (IE), which transforms patient narratives into structured medical entities and relations. Accuracy was assessed across five patient cohorts through comparisons with BERT models, and LLaMA-3 and DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o models. Evaluation settings included (1) in-domain training and testing, (2) external validation on independent cohorts, and (3) a low-resource new-site adaptation scenario using real-world clinical notes from the Yale New Haven Health System.]]></description>

Simulating the long-time evolution of Hamiltonian systems is limited by the small timesteps required for stable numerical integration. To overcome this constraint, we introduce a framework to learn Hamiltonian Flow Maps by predicting the mean phase-space evolution over a chosen time span $Δt$, enabling stable large-timestep updates far beyond the stability limits of classical integrators. To this end, we impose a Mean Flow consistency condition for time-averaged Hamiltonian dynamics. Unlike prior approaches, this allows training on independent phase-space samples without access to future states, avoiding expensive trajectory generation. Validated across diverse Hamiltonian systems, our method in particular improves upon molecular dynamics simulations using machine-learned force fields (MLFF). Our models maintain comparable training and inference cost, but support significantly larger integration timesteps while trained directly on widely-available trajectory-free MLFF datasets.]]></description>

Automatically discovering formulaic alpha factors is a central problem in quantitative finance. Existing methods often ignore syntactic and semantic constraints, relying on exhaustive search over unstructured and unbounded spaces. We present AlphaCFG, a grammar-based framework for defining and discovering alpha factors that are syntactically valid, financially interpretable, and computationally efficient. AlphaCFG uses an alpha-oriented context-free grammar to define a tree-structured, size-controlled search space, and formulates alpha discovery as a tree-structured linguistic Markov decision process, which is then solved using a grammar-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by syntax-sensitive value and policy networks. Experiments on Chinese and U.S. stock market datasets show that AlphaCFG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both search efficiency and trading profitability. Beyond trading strategies, AlphaCFG serves as a general framework for symbolic factor discovery and refinement across quantitative finance, including asset pricing and portfolio construction.]]></description>

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been on the rise in many domains, including numerous safety-critical applications. However, for complex systems found in the real world, or when data already exist, defining the underlying environmental conditions is extremely challenging. This often results in an incomplete description of the environment in which the AI-based system must operate. Nevertheless, this description, called the Operational Design Domain (ODD), is required in many domains for the certification of AI-based systems. Traditionally, the ODD is created in the early stages of the development process, drawing on sophisticated expert knowledge and related standards. This paper presents a novel Safety-by-Design method to a posteriori define the ODD from previously collected data using a multi-dimensional kernel-based representation. This approach is validated through both Monte Carlo methods and a real-world aviation use case for a future safety-critical collision-avoidance system. Moreover, by defining under what conditions two ODDs are equal, the paper shows that the data-driven ODD can equal the original, underlying hidden ODD of the data. Utilizing the novel, Safe-by-Design kernel-based ODD enables future certification of data-driven, safety-critical AI-based systems.]]></description>

We present the first application of MAP-Elites, a quality-diversity algorithm, to trade execution. Rather than searching for a single optimal policy, MAP-Elites generates a diverse portfolio of regime-specialist strategies indexed by liquidity and volatility conditions. Individual specialists achieve 8-10% performance improvements within their behavioural niches, while other cells show degradation, suggesting opportunities for ensemble approaches that combine improved specialists with the baseline PPO policy. Results indicate that quality-diversity methods offer promise for regime-adaptive execution, though substantial computational resources per behavioural cell may be required for robust specialist development across all market conditions. To ensure experimental integrity, we develop a calibrated Gymnasium environment focused on order scheduling rather than tactical placement decisions. The simulator features a transient impact model with exponential decay and square-root volume scaling, fit to 400+ U.S. equities with R^2>0.02 out-of-sample. Within this environment, two Proximal Policy Optimization architectures - both MLP and CNN feature extractors - demonstrate substantial improvements over industry baselines, with the CNN variant achieving 2.13 bps arrival slippage versus 5.23 bps for VWAP on 4,900 out-of-sample orders ($21B notional). These results validate both the simulation realism and provide strong single-policy baselines for quality-diversity methods.]]></description>

Accurate reconstruction of atmospheric wind fields is essential for applications such as weather forecasting, hazard prediction, and wind energy assessment, yet conventional instruments leave spatio-temporal gaps within the lower atmospheric boundary layer. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) provide flexible in situ measurements, but individual platforms sample wind only along their flight trajectories, limiting full wind-field recovery. This study presents a framework for reconstructing four-dimensional atmospheric wind fields using measurements obtained from a coordinated UAS swarm. A synthetic turbulence environment and high-fidelity multirotor simulation are used to generate training and evaluation data. Local wind components are estimated from UAS dynamics using a bidirectional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) and assimilated into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to reconstruct a continuous wind field in space and time. For local wind estimation, the bidirectional LSTM achieves root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 0.064 and 0.062 m/s for the north and east components in low-wind conditions, increasing to 0.122 to 0.129 m/s under moderate winds and 0.271 to 0.273 m/s in high-wind conditions, while the vertical component exhibits higher error, with RMSE values of 0.029 to 0.091 m/s. The physics-informed reconstruction recovers the dominant spatial and temporal structure of the wind field up to 1000 m altitude while preserving mean flow direction and vertical shear. Under moderate wind conditions, the reconstructed mean wind field achieves an overall RMSE between 0.118 and 0.154 m/s across evaluated UAS configurations, with the lowest error obtained using a five-UAS swarm. These results demonstrate that coordinated UAS measurements enable accurate and scalable four-dimensional wind-field reconstruction without dedicated wind sensors or fixed infrastructure.]]></description>

Can a small amount of verified goal information steer the expensive self-supervised pretraining of foundation models? Standard pretraining optimizes a fixed proxy objective (e.g., next-token prediction), which can misallocate compute away from downstream capabilities of interest. We introduce V-Pretraining: a value-based, modality-agnostic method for controlled continued pretraining in which a lightweight task designer reshapes the pretraining task to maximize the value of each gradient step. For example, consider self-supervised learning (SSL) with sample augmentation. The V-Pretraining task designer selects pretraining tasks (e.g., augmentations) for which the pretraining loss gradient is aligned with a gradient computed over a downstream task (e.g., image segmentation). This helps steer pretraining towards relevant downstream capabilities. Notably, the pretrained model is never updated on downstream task labels; they are used only to shape the pretraining task. Under matched learner update budgets, V-Pretraining of 0.5B--7B language models improves reasoning (GSM8K test Pass@1) by up to 18% relative over standard next-token prediction using only 12% of GSM8K training examples as feedback. In vision SSL, we improve the state-of-the-art results on ADE20K by up to 1.07 mIoU and reduce NYUv2 RMSE while improving ImageNet linear accuracy, and we provide pilot evidence of improved token efficiency in continued pretraining.]]></description>

We introduce Prior-Informed Flow Matching (PIFM), a conditional flow model for graph reconstruction. Reconstructing graphs from partial observations remains a key challenge; classical embedding methods often lack global consistency, while modern generative models struggle to incorporate structural priors. PIFM bridges this gap by integrating embedding-based priors with continuous-time flow matching. Grounded in a permutation equivariant version of the distortion-perception theory, our method first uses a prior, such as graphons or GraphSAGE/node2vec, to form an informed initial estimate of the adjacency matrix based on local information. It then applies rectified flow matching to refine this estimate, transporting it toward the true distribution of clean graphs and learning a global coupling. Experiments on different datasets demonstrate that PIFM consistently enhances classical embeddings, outperforming them and state-of-the-art generative baselines in reconstruction accuracy.]]></description>

Quantization has significantly improved the compute and memory efficiency of Large Language Model (LLM) training. However, existing approaches still rely on accumulating their updates in high-precision: concretely, gradient updates must be applied to a high-precision weight buffer, known as $\textit{master weights}$. This buffer introduces substantial memory overhead, particularly for Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) models, where model parameters and optimizer states dominate memory usage. To address this, we introduce the Error-Compensating Optimizer (ECO), which eliminates master weights by applying updates directly to quantized parameters. ECO quantizes weights after each step and carefully injects the resulting quantization error into the optimizer momentum, forming an error-feedback loop with no additional memory. We prove that, under standard assumptions and a decaying learning rate, ECO converges to a constant-radius neighborhood of the optimum, while naive master-weight removal can incur an error that is inversely proportional to the learning rate. We show empirical results for pretraining small Transformers (30-800M), a Gemma-3 1B model, and a 2.1B parameter Sparse MoE model with FP8 quantization, and fine-tuning DeepSeek-MoE-16B in INT4 precision. Throughout, ECO matches baselines with master weights up to near-lossless accuracy, significantly shifting the static memory vs validation loss Pareto frontier.]]></description>

Optimizing Conditional Value-at-risk (CVaR) using policy gradient (a.k.a CVaR-PG) faces significant challenges of sample inefficiency. This inefficiency stems from the fact that it focuses on tail-end performance and overlooks many sampled trajectories. We address this problem by augmenting CVaR with an expected quantile term. Quantile optimization admits a dynamic programming formulation that leverages all sampled data, thus improves sample efficiency. This does not alter the CVaR objective since CVaR corresponds to the expectation of quantile over the tail. Empirical results in domains with verifiable risk-averse behavior show that our algorithm within the Markovian policy class substantially improves upon CVaR-PG and consistently outperforms other existing methods.]]></description>

The placement of normalization layers, specifically Pre-Norm and Post-Norm, remains an open question in Transformer architecture design. In this work, we rethink these approaches through the lens of manifold optimization, interpreting the outputs of the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) and attention layers as update directions in optimization. Building on this perspective, we introduce GeoNorm, a novel method that replaces standard normalization with geodesic updates on the manifold. Furthermore, analogous to learning rate schedules, we propose a layer-wise update decay for the FFN and attention components. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GeoNorm consistently outperforms existing normalization methods in Transformer models. Crucially, GeoNorm can be seamlessly integrated into standard Transformer architectures, achieving performance improvements with negligible additional computational cost.]]></description>

In this paper, we propose a 3D asset-referenced diffusion model for image generation, exploring how to integrate 3D assets into image diffusion models. Existing reference-based image generation methods leverage large-scale pretrained diffusion models and demonstrate strong capability in generating diverse images conditioned on a single reference image. However, these methods are limited to single-image references and cannot leverage 3D assets, constraining their practical versatility. To address this gap, we present a cross-domain diffusion model with dual-branch perception that leverages multi-view RGB images and point maps of 3D assets to jointly model their colors and canonical-space coordinates, achieving precise consistency between generated images and the 3D references. Our spatially aligned dual-branch generation architecture and domain-decoupled generation mechanism ensure the simultaneous generation of two spatially aligned but content-disentangled outputs, RGB images and point maps, linking 2D image attributes with 3D asset attributes. Experiments show that our approach effectively uses 3D assets as references to produce images consistent with the given assets, opening new possibilities for combining diffusion models with 3D content creation.]]></description>

Social bias in generative AI can manifest not only as performance disparities but also as associational bias, whereby models learn and reproduce stereotypical associations between concepts and demographic groups, even in the absence of explicit demographic information (e.g., associating doctors with men). These associations can persist, propagate, and potentially amplify across repeated exchanges in inter-model communication pipelines, where one generative model's output becomes another's input. This is especially salient for human-centred perception tasks, such as human activity recognition and affect prediction, where inferences about behaviour and internal states can lead to errors or stereotypical associations that propagate into unequal treatment. In this work, focusing on human activity and affective expression, we study how such associations evolve within an inter-model communication pipeline that alternates between image generation and image description. Using the RAF-DB and PHASE datasets, we quantify demographic distribution drift induced by model-to-model information exchange and assess whether these drifts are systematic using an explainability pipeline. Our results reveal demographic drifts toward younger representations for both actions and emotions, as well as toward more female-presenting representations, primarily for emotions. We further find evidence that some predictions are supported by spurious visual regions (e.g., background or hair) rather than concept-relevant cues (e.g., body or face). We also examine whether these demographic drifts translate into measurable differences in downstream behaviour, i.e., while predicting activity and emotion labels. Finally, we outline mitigation strategies spanning data-centric, training and deployment interventions, and emphasise the need for careful safeguards when deploying interconnected models in human-centred AI systems.]]></description>

Partial differential equation (PDE) simulations are fundamental to engineering and physics but are often computationally prohibitive for real-time applications. While generative AI offers a promising avenue for surrogate modeling, standard video generation architectures lack the specific control and data compatibility required for physical simulations. This paper introduces a geometry aware world model architecture, derived from a video generation architecture (LongVideoGAN), designed to learn transient physics. We introduce two key architecture elements: (1) a twofold conditioning mechanism incorporating global physical parameters and local geometric masks, and (2) an architectural adaptation to support arbitrary channel dimensions, moving beyond standard RGB constraints. We evaluate this approach on a 2D transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problem involving convective heat transfer from buoyancy-driven flow coupled to a heat flow in a solid structure. We demonstrate that the conditioned model successfully reproduces complex temporal dynamics and spatial correlations of the training data. Furthermore, we assess the model's generalization capabilities on unseen geometric configurations, highlighting both its potential for controlled simulation synthesis and current limitations in spatial precision for out-of-distribution samples.]]></description>

Learning from human feedback typically relies on preference optimization that constrains policy updates through token-level regularization. However, preference optimization for language models is particularly challenging because token-space similarity does not imply semantic or behavioral similarity. To address this challenge, we leverage latent-space regularization for language model preference optimization. We introduce GANPO, which achieves latent-space regularization by penalizing divergence between the internal representations of a policy model and a reference model. Given that latent representations are not associated with explicit probability densities, we adopt an adversarial approach inspired by GANs to minimize latent-space divergence. We integrate GANPO as a regularizer into existing offline preference optimization objectives. Experiments across multiple model architectures and tasks show consistent improvements from latent-space regularization. Further, by comparing GANPO-induced inferential biases with those from token-level regularization, we find that GANPO provides more robust structural feedback under distributional shift and noise while maintaining comparable downstream performance with minor computational overhead.]]></description>

Energy is now a critical ML computing resource. While measuring energy consumption and observing trends is a valuable first step, accurately understanding and diagnosing why those differences occur is crucial for optimization. To that end, we begin by presenting a large-scale measurement study of inference time and energy across the generative AI landscape with 46 models, 7 tasks, and 1,858 different configurations on NVIDIA H100 and B200 GPUs. Our empirical findings span order-of-magnitude variations: LLM task type can lead to 25$\times$ energy differences, video generation sometimes consumes more than 100$\times$ the energy of images, and GPU utilization differences can result in 3--5$\times$ energy differences. Based on our observations, we present a framework for reasoning about the underlying mechanisms that govern time and energy consumption. The essence is that time and energy are determined by latent metrics like memory and utilization, which are in turn affected by various factors across the algorithm, software, and hardware layers. Our framework also extends directly to throughput per watt, a critical metric for power-constrained datacenters.]]></description>

Designing high-performance optical lenses entails exploring a high-dimensional, tightly constrained space of surface curvatures, glass choices, element thicknesses, and spacings. In practice, standard optimizers (e.g., gradient-based local search and evolutionary strategies) often converge to a single local optimum, overlooking many comparably good alternatives that matter for downstream engineering decisions. We propose the Lens Descriptor-Guided Evolutionary Algorithm (LDG-EA), a two-stage framework for multimodal lens optimization. LDG-EA first partitions the design space into behavior descriptors defined by curvature-sign patterns and material indices, then learns a probabilistic model over descriptors to allocate evaluations toward promising regions. Within each descriptor, LDG-EA applies the Hill-Valley Evolutionary Algorithm with covariance-matrix self-adaptation to recover multiple distinct local minima, optionally followed by gradient-based refinement. On a 24-variable (18 continuous and 6 integer), six-element Double-Gauss topology, LDG-EA generates on average around 14500 candidate minima spanning 636 unique descriptors, an order of magnitude more than a CMA-ES baseline, while keeping wall-clock time at one hour scale. Although the best LDG-EA design is slightly worse than a fine-tuned reference lens, it remains in the same performance range. Overall, the proposed LDG-EA produces a diverse set of solutions while maintaining competitive quality within practical computational budgets and wall-clock time.]]></description>

Foundation models have become a dominant paradigm in machine learning, achieving remarkable performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining. However, these models often yield overconfident, uncalibrated predictions. The standard approach to quantifying epistemic uncertainty, training an ensemble of independent models, incurs prohibitive computational costs that scale linearly with ensemble size, making it impractical for large foundation models. We propose Singular Value Ensemble (SVE), a parameter-efficient implicit ensemble method that builds on a simple, but powerful core assumption: namely, that the singular vectors of the weight matrices constitute meaningful subspaces of the model's knowledge. Pretrained foundation models encode rich, transferable information in their weight matrices. If the singular vectors are indeed meaningful (orthogonal) "knowledge directions". To obtain a model ensemble, we modulate only how strongly each direction contributes to the output. Rather than learning entirely new parameters, we freeze the singular vectors and only train per-member singular values that rescale the contribution of each direction in that shared knowledge basis. Ensemble diversity emerges naturally as stochastic initialization and random sampling of mini-batches during joint training cause different members to converge to different combinations of the same underlying knowledge. SVE achieves uncertainty quantification comparable to explicit deep ensembles while increasing the parameter count of the base model by less than 1%, making principled uncertainty estimation accessible in resource-constrained settings. We validate SVE on NLP and vision tasks with various different backbones and show that it improves calibration while maintaining predictive accuracy.]]></description>

The Segment Anything Model has revolutionized image segmentation with its zero-shot capabilities, yet its reliance on manual prompts hinders fully automated deployment. While integrating object detectors as prompt generators offers a pathway to automation, existing pipelines suffer from two fundamental limitations: objective mismatch, where detectors optimized for geometric localization do not correspond to the optimal prompting context required by SAM, and alignment overfitting in standard joint training, where the detector simply memorizes specific prompt adjustments for training samples rather than learning a generalizable policy. To bridge this gap, we introduce BLO-Inst, a unified framework that aligns detection and segmentation objectives by bi-level optimization. We formulate the alignment as a nested optimization problem over disjoint data splits. In the lower level, the SAM is fine-tuned to maximize segmentation fidelity given the current detection proposals on a subset ($D_1$). In the upper level, the detector is updated to generate bounding boxes that explicitly minimize the validation loss of the fine-tuned SAM on a separate subset ($D_2$). This effectively transforms the detector into a segmentation-aware prompt generator, optimizing the bounding boxes not just for localization accuracy, but for downstream mask quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BLO-Inst achieves superior performance, outperforming standard baselines on tasks in general and biomedical domains.]]></description>

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a broad range of vision tasks. However, constrained by the capacity of their internal world knowledge, prior work has proposed augmenting MLLMs by ``reasoning-then-tool-call'' for visual and textual search engines to obtain substantial gains on tasks requiring extensive factual information. However, these approaches typically define multimodal search in a naive setting, assuming that a single full-level or entity-level image query and few text query suffices to retrieve the key evidence needed to answer the question, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios with substantial visual noise. Moreover, they are often limited in the reasoning depth and search breadth, making it difficult to solve complex questions that require aggregating evidence from diverse visual and textual sources. Building on this, we propose Vision-DeepResearch, which proposes one new multimodal deep-research paradigm, i.e., performs multi-turn, multi-entity and multi-scale visual and textual search to robustly hit real-world search engines under heavy noise. Our Vision-DeepResearch supports dozens of reasoning steps and hundreds of engine interactions, while internalizing deep-research capabilities into the MLLM via cold-start supervision and RL training, resulting in a strong end-to-end multimodal deep-research MLLM. It substantially outperforming existing multimodal deep-research MLLMs, and workflows built on strong closed-source foundation model such as GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-4-Sonnet. The code will be released in https://github.com/Osilly/Vision-DeepResearch.]]></description>

Decomposing complex data into factorized representations can reveal reusable components and enable synthesizing new samples via component recombination. We investigate this in the context of diffusion-based models that learn factorized latent spaces without factor-level supervision. In images, factors can capture background, illumination, and object attributes; in robotic videos, they can capture reusable motion components. To improve both latent factor discovery and quality of compositional generation, we introduce an adversarial training signal via a discriminator trained to distinguish between single-source samples and those generated by recombining factors across sources. By optimizing the generator to fool this discriminator, we encourage physical and semantic consistency in the resulting recombinations. Our method outperforms implementations of prior baselines on CelebA-HQ, Virtual KITTI, CLEVR, and Falcor3D, achieving lower FID scores and better disentanglement as measured by MIG and MCC. Furthermore, we demonstrate a novel application to robotic video trajectories: by recombining learned action components, we generate diverse sequences that significantly increase state-space coverage for exploration on the LIBERO benchmark.]]></description>

Retrieval-augmented generation is a practical paradigm for question answering over long documents, but it remains brittle for multimodal reading where text, tables, and figures are interleaved across many pages. First, flat chunking breaks document-native structure and cross-modal alignment, yielding semantic fragments that are hard to interpret in isolation. Second, even iterative retrieval can fail in long contexts by looping on partial evidence or drifting into irrelevant sections as noise accumulates, since each step is guided only by the current snippet without a persistent global search state. We introduce $G^2$-Reader, a dual-graph system, to address both issues. It evolves a Content Graph to preserve document-native structure and cross-modal semantics, and maintains a Planning Graph, an agentic directed acyclic graph of sub-questions, to track intermediate findings and guide stepwise navigation for evidence completion. On VisDoMBench across five multimodal domains, $G^2$-Reader with Qwen3-VL-32B-Instruct reaches 66.21\% average accuracy, outperforming strong baselines and a standalone GPT-5 (53.08\%).]]></description>

Scaling has powered recent advances in vision foundation models, yet extending this paradigm to metric depth estimation remains challenging due to heterogeneous sensor noise, camera-dependent biases, and metric ambiguity in noisy cross-source 3D data. We introduce Metric Anything, a simple and scalable pretraining framework that learns metric depth from noisy, diverse 3D sources without manually engineered prompts, camera-specific modeling, or task-specific architectures. Central to our approach is the Sparse Metric Prompt, created by randomly masking depth maps, which serves as a universal interface that decouples spatial reasoning from sensor and camera biases. Using about 20M image-depth pairs spanning reconstructed, captured, and rendered 3D data across 10000 camera models, we demonstrate-for the first time-a clear scaling trend in the metric depth track. The pretrained model excels at prompt-driven tasks such as depth completion, super-resolution and Radar-camera fusion, while its distilled prompt-free student achieves state-of-the-art results on monocular depth estimation, camera intrinsics recovery, single/multi-view metric 3D reconstruction, and VLA planning. We also show that using pretrained ViT of Metric Anything as a visual encoder significantly boosts Multimodal Large Language Model capabilities in spatial intelligence. These results show that metric depth estimation can benefit from the same scaling laws that drive modern foundation models, establishing a new path toward scalable and efficient real-world metric perception. We open-source MetricAnything at http://metric-anything.github.io/metric-anything-io/ to support community research.]]></description>

In recent years, multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an inseparable part of daily life, making it crucial for them to master the rules of conversational language in order to communicate effectively with users. While previous work has evaluated LLMs' understanding of figurative language in high-resource languages, their performance in low-resource languages remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce MasalBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs' contextual and cross-cultural understanding of Persian proverbs, which are a key component of conversation in this low-resource language. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs on MasalBench and find that they perform well in identifying Persian proverbs in context, achieving accuracies above 0.90. However, their performance drops considerably when tasked with identifying equivalent English proverbs, with the best model achieving 0.79 accuracy. Our findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in cultural knowledge and analogical reasoning, and they provide a framework for assessing cross-cultural understanding in other low-resource languages. MasalBench is available at https://github.com/kalhorghazal/MasalBench.]]></description>

Instruction following aims to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent by specifying explicit constraints on how tasks should be performed. However, we reveal a counterintuitive phenomenon: instruction following can paradoxically interfere with LLMs' task-solving capability. We propose a metric, SUSTAINSCORE, to quantify the interference of instruction following with task solving. It measures task performance drop after inserting into the instruction a self-evident constraint, which is naturally met by the original successful model output and extracted from it. Experiments on current LLMs in mathematics, multi-hop QA, and code generation show that adding the self-evident constraints leads to substantial performance drops, even for advanced models such as Claude-Sonnet-4.5. We validate the generality of the interference across constraint types and scales. Furthermore, we identify common failure patterns, and by investigating the mechanisms of interference, we observe that failed cases allocate significantly more attention to constraints compared to successful ones. Finally, we use SUSTAINSCORE to conduct an initial investigation into how distinct post-training paradigms affect the interference, presenting empirical observations on current alignment strategies. We will release our code and data to facilitate further research]]></description>

Streaming reconstruction from monocular image sequences remains challenging, as existing methods typically favor either high-quality rendering or accurate geometry, but rarely both. We present PLANING, an efficient on-the-fly reconstruction framework built on a hybrid representation that loosely couples explicit geometric primitives with neural Gaussians, enabling geometry and appearance to be modeled in a decoupled manner. This decoupling supports an online initialization and optimization strategy that separates geometry and appearance updates, yielding stable streaming reconstruction with substantially reduced structural redundancy. PLANING improves dense mesh Chamfer-L2 by 18.52% over PGSR, surpasses ARTDECO by 1.31 dB PSNR, and reconstructs ScanNetV2 scenes in under 100 seconds, over 5x faster than 2D Gaussian Splatting, while matching the quality of offline per-scene optimization. Beyond reconstruction quality, the structural clarity and computational efficiency of \modelname~make it well suited for a broad range of downstream applications, such as enabling large-scale scene modeling and simulation-ready environments for embodied AI.

Neural surface reconstruction (NSR) has recently shown strong potential for urban 3D reconstruction from multi-view aerial imagery. However, existing NSR methods often suffer from geometric ambiguity and instability, particularly under sparse-view conditions. This issue is critical in large-scale urban remote sensing, where aerial image acquisition is limited by flight paths, terrain, and cost. To address this challenge, we present the first urban NSR framework that fuses 3D synthetic aperture radar (SAR) point clouds with aerial imagery for high-fidelity reconstruction under constrained, sparse-view settings. 3D SAR can efficiently capture large-scale geometry even from a single side-looking flight path, providing robust priors that complement photometric cues from images. Our framework integrates radar-derived spatial constraints into an SDF-based NSR backbone, guiding structure-aware ray selection and adaptive sampling for stable and efficient optimization. We also construct the first benchmark dataset with co-registered 3D SAR point clouds and aerial imagery, facilitating systematic evaluation of cross-modal 3D reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that incorporating 3D SAR markedly enhances reconstruction accuracy, completeness, and robustness compared with single-modality baselines under highly sparse and oblique-view conditions, highlighting a viable route toward scalable high-fidelity urban reconstruction with advanced airborne and spaceborne optical-SAR sensing.]]></description>

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) promises adaptive control for future mobile networks but conventional agents remain reactive: they act on past and current measurements and cannot leverage short-term forecasts of exogenous KPIs such as bandwidth. Augmenting agents with predictions can overcome this temporal myopia, yet uptake in networking is scarce because forecast-aware agents act as closed-boxes; operators cannot tell whether predictions guide decisions or justify the added complexity. We propose SIA, the first interpreter that exposes in real time how forecast-augmented DRL agents operate. SIA fuses Symbolic AI abstractions with per-KPI Knowledge Graphs to produce explanations, and includes a new Influence Score metric. SIA achieves sub-millisecond speed, over 200x faster than existing XAI methods. We evaluate SIA on three diverse networking use cases, uncovering hidden issues, including temporal misalignment in forecast integration and reward-design biases that trigger counter-productive policies. These insights enable targeted fixes: a redesigned agent achieves a 9% higher average bitrate in video streaming, and SIA's online Action-Refinement module improves RAN-slicing reward by 25% without retraining. By making anticipatory DRL transparent and tunable, SIA lowers the barrier to proactive control in next-generation mobile networks.]]></description>

Emergent communication offers insight into how agents develop shared structured representations, yet most research assumes homogeneous modalities or aligned representational spaces, overlooking the perceptual heterogeneity of real-world settings. We study a heterogeneous multi-step binary communication game where agents differ in modality and lack perceptual grounding. Despite perceptual misalignment, multimodal systems converge to class-consistent messages grounded in perceptual input. Unimodal systems communicate more efficiently, using fewer bits and achieving lower classification entropy, while multimodal agents require greater information exchange and exhibit higher uncertainty. Bit perturbation experiments provide strong evidence that meaning is encoded in a distributional rather than compositional manner, as each bit's contribution depends on its surrounding pattern. Finally, interoperability analyses show that systems trained in different perceptual worlds fail to directly communicate, but limited fine-tuning enables successful cross-system communication. This work positions emergent communication as a framework for studying how agents adapt and transfer representations across heterogeneous modalities, opening new directions for both theory and experimentation.]]></description>

Transformer scaling law analyses typically treat parameters as interchangeable; an abstraction that accurately predicts loss-compute relationships. Yet, in sub-billion-parameter small language models (SLMs), embedding matrices dominate the parameter budget. This work argues that this allocation is as suboptimal as it is counterintuitive. Leviathan is an architecture with a continuous embedding generator to replace the discrete lookup tables of canonical models. Evaluating on the Pile dataset under isoparametric settings, Leviathan consistently outperforms a standard, LLaMA-style architecture. By means of an empirical power-law fit, Leviathan exhibits a markedly superior effective parameter capacity. Across the regime studied, Leviathan behaves as a dense model with $1.47$ to $2.11 \times$ more parameters.]]></description>

Human action anticipation is commonly treated as a video understanding problem, implicitly assuming that dense temporal information is required to reason about future actions. In this work, we challenge this assumption by investigating what can be achieved when action anticipation is constrained to a single visual observation. We ask a fundamental question: how much information about the future is already encoded in a single frame, and how can it be effectively exploited? Building on our prior work on Action Anticipation at a Glimpse (AAG), we conduct a systematic investigation of single-frame action anticipation enriched with complementary sources of information. We analyze the contribution of RGB appearance, depth-based geometric cues, and semantic representations of past actions, and investigate how different multimodal fusion strategies, keyframe selection policies and past-action history sources influence anticipation performance. Guided by these findings, we consolidate the most effective design choices into AAG+, a refined single-frame anticipation framework. Despite operating on a single frame, AAG+ consistently improves upon the original AAG and achieves performance comparable to, or exceeding, that of state-of-the-art video-based methods on challenging anticipation benchmarks including IKEA-ASM, Meccano and Assembly101. Our results offer new insights into the limits and potential of single-frame action anticipation, and clarify when dense temporal modeling is necessary and when a carefully selected glimpse is sufficient.]]></description>

Agentic AI enables LLM to dynamically reason, plan, and interact with tools to solve complex tasks. However, agentic workflows often require many iterative reasoning steps and tool invocations, leading to significant operational expense, end-to-end latency and failures due to hallucinations. This work introduces Agent Workflow Optimization (AWO), a framework that identifies and optimizes redundant tool execution patterns to improve the efficiency and robustness of agentic workflows. AWO analyzes existing workflow traces to discover recurring sequences of tool calls and transforms them into meta-tools, which are deterministic, composite tools that bundle multiple agent actions into a single invocation. Meta-tools bypass unnecessary intermediate LLM reasoning steps and reduce operational cost while also shortening execution paths, leading to fewer failures. Experiments on two agentic AI benchmarks show that AWO reduces the number of LLM calls up to 11.9% while also increasing the task success rate by up to 4.2 percent points.]]></description>

Quantifying degrees of fusion and separability between data groups in representation space is a fundamental problem in representation learning, particularly under domain shift. A meaningful metric should capture fusion-altering factors like geometric displacement between representation groups, whose variations change the extent of fusion, while remaining invariant to fusion-preserving factors such as global scaling and sampling-induced layout changes, whose variations do not. Existing distributional distance metrics conflate these factors, leading to measures that are not informative of the true extent of fusion between data groups. We introduce Cross-Fusion Distance (CFD), a principled measure that isolates fusion-altering geometry while remaining robust to fusion-preserving variations, with linear computational complexity. We characterize the invariance and sensitivity properties of CFD theoretically and validate them in controlled synthetic experiments. For practical utility on real-world datasets with domain shift, CFD aligns more closely with downstream generalization degradation than commonly used alternatives. Overall, CFD provides a theoretically grounded and interpretable distance measure for representation learning.]]></description>

Autoregressive (AR) language models enforce a fixed left-to-right generation order, creating a fundamental limitation when the required output structure conflicts with natural reasoning (e.g., producing answers before explanations due to presentation or schema constraints). In such cases, AR models must commit to answers before generating intermediate reasoning, and this rigid constraint forces premature commitment. Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs), which iteratively refine all tokens in parallel, offer a way to decouple computation order from output structure. We validate this capability on GSM8K, Math500, and ReasonOrderQA, a benchmark we introduce with controlled difficulty and order-level evaluation. When prompts request answers before reasoning, AR models exhibit large accuracy gaps compared to standard chain-of-thought ordering (up to 67% relative drop), while MDLMs remain stable ($\leq$14% relative drop), a property we term "order robustness". Using ReasonOrderQA, we present evidence that MDLMs achieve order robustness by stabilizing simpler tokens (e.g., reasoning steps) earlier in the diffusion process than complex ones (e.g., final answers), enabling reasoning tokens to stabilize before answer commitment. Finally, we identify failure conditions where this advantage weakens, outlining the limits required for order robustness.]]></description>

We present a framework for generative machine learning that leverages the holographic principle of quantum gravity, or to be more precise its manifestation as the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, with techniques for deep learning and transport theory. Our proposal is to represent the flow of data from a base distribution to some learned distribution using the bulk-to-boundary mapping of scalar fields in AdS. In the language of machine learning, we are representing and augmenting the flow-matching algorithm with AdS physics. Using a checkerboard toy dataset and MNIST, we find that our model achieves faster and higher quality convergence than comparable physics-free flow-matching models. Our method provides a physically interpretable version of flow matching. More broadly, it establishes the utility of AdS physics and geometry in the development of novel paradigms in generative modeling.]]></description>

End-to-end autonomous driving increasingly leverages self-supervised video pretraining to learn transferable planning representations. However, pretraining video world models for scene understanding has so far brought only limited improvements. This limitation is compounded by the inherent ambiguity of driving: each scene typically provides only a single human trajectory, making it difficult to learn multimodal behaviors. In this work, we propose Drive-JEPA, a framework that integrates Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with multimodal trajectory distillation for end-to-end driving. First, we adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving, pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Second, we introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories, with a momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. When evaluated on NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation combined with a simple transformer-based decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting. The complete Drive-JEPA framework achieves 93.3 PDMS on v1 and 87.8 EPDMS on v2, setting a new state-of-the-art.]]></description>

In this work, we propose Causal Autoregressive Diffusion (CARD), a novel framework that unifies the training efficiency of ARMs with the high-throughput inference of diffusion models. CARD reformulates the diffusion process within a strictly causal attention mask, enabling dense, per-token supervision in a single forward pass. To address the optimization instability of causal diffusion, we introduce a soft-tailed masking schema to preserve local context and a context-aware reweighting mechanism derived from signal-to-noise principles. This design enables dynamic parallel decoding, where the model leverages KV-caching to adaptively generate variable-length token sequences based on confidence. Empirically, CARD outperforms existing discrete diffusion baselines while reducing training latency by 3 $\times$ compared to block diffusion methods. Our results demonstrate that CARD achieves ARM-level data efficiency while unlocking the latency benefits of parallel generation, establishing a robust paradigm for next-generation efficient LLMs.]]></description>

In large language model (LLM) unlearning, private information is required to be removed. Task arithmetic unlearns by subtracting a specific task vector (TV)--defined as the parameter difference between a privacy-information-tuned model and the original model. While efficient, it can cause over-forgetting by disrupting parameters essential for retaining other information. Motivated by the observation that each parameter exhibits different importance for forgetting versus retention, we propose a per-parameter task arithmetic (PerTA) mechanism to rescale the TV, allowing per-parameter adjustment. These weights quantify the relative importance of each parameter for forgetting versus retention, estimated via gradients (i.e., PerTA-grad) or the diagonal Fisher information approximation (i.e., PerTA-fisher). Moreover, we discuss the effectiveness of PerTA, extend it to a more general form, and provide further analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PerTA consistently improves upon standard TV, and in many cases surpasses widely used training-based unlearning methods in both forgetting effectiveness and overall model utility. By retaining the efficiency of task arithmetic while mitigating over-forgetting, PerTA offers a principled and practical framework for LLM unlearning.]]></description>

We introduce a new multivariate statistical problem that we refer to as the Ensemble Inverse Problem (EIP). The aim of EIP is to invert for an ensemble that is distributed according to the pushforward of a prior under a forward process. In high energy physics (HEP), this is related to a widely known problem called unfolding, which aims to reconstruct the true physics distribution of quantities, such as momentum and angle, from measurements that are distorted by detector effects. In recent applications, the EIP also arises in full waveform inversion (FWI) and inverse imaging with unknown priors. We propose non-iterative inference-time methods that construct posterior samplers based on a new class of conditional generative models, which we call ensemble inverse generative models. For the posterior modeling, these models additionally use the ensemble information contained in the observation set on top of single measurements. Unlike existing methods, our proposed methods avoid explicit and iterative use of the forward model at inference time via training across several sets of truth-observation pairs that are consistent with the same forward model, but originate from a wide range of priors. We demonstrate that this training procedure implicitly encodes the likelihood model. The use of ensemble information helps posterior inference and enables generalization to unseen priors. We benchmark the proposed method on several synthetic and real datasets in inverse imaging, HEP, and FWI. The codes are available at https://github.com/ZhengyanHuan/The-Ensemble-Inverse-Problem--Applications-and-Methods.]]></description>

Most LLM unlearning methods aim to approximate retrain-from-scratch behaviors with minimal distribution shift, often via alignment-style objectives defined in the prediction space. While effective at reducing forgotten content generation, such approaches may act as suppression: forgotten concepts can persist in representations and remain entangled with retained knowledge. We introduce CLReg, a contrastive representation regularizer that identifies forget features while pushing them away from retain features, explicitly reducing forget-retain interference with minimal shifts on retain features. We provide first theoretical insights that relate representation shaping to entanglement reduction. Across unlearning benchmarks and LLMs of different sizes, CLReg decreases forget-retain representation entanglement that facilitates mainstream unlearning methods without positing extra privacy risks, inspiring future work that reshapes the representation space to remove forget concepts.]]></description>

Existing benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents focus on task completion under idealistic settings but overlook reliability in real-world, user-facing applications. In domains, such as in-car voice assistants, users often issue incomplete or ambiguous requests, creating intrinsic uncertainty that agents must manage through dialogue, tool use, and policy adherence. We introduce CAR-bench, a benchmark for evaluating consistency, uncertainty handling, and capability awareness in multi-turn, tool-using LLM agents in an in-car assistant domain. The environment features an LLM-simulated user, domain policies, and 58 interconnected tools spanning navigation, productivity, charging, and vehicle control. Beyond standard task completion, CAR-bench introduces Hallucination tasks that test agents' limit-awareness under missing tools or information, and Disambiguation tasks that require resolving uncertainty through clarification or internal information gathering. Baseline results reveal large gaps between occasional and consistent success on all task types. Even frontier reasoning LLMs achieve less than 50% consistent pass rate on Disambiguation tasks due to premature actions, and frequently violate policies or fabricate information to satisfy user requests in Hallucination tasks, underscoring the need for more reliable and self-aware LLM agents in real-world settings.]]></description>

Volumetric medical imaging offers great potential for understanding complex pathologies. Yet, traditional 2D slices provide little support for interpreting spatial relationships, forcing users to mentally reconstruct anatomy into three dimensions. Direct volumetric path tracing and VR rendering can improve perception but are computationally expensive, while precomputed representations, like Gaussian Splatting, require planning ahead. Both approaches limit interactive use.
  We propose a hybrid rendering approach for high-quality, interactive, and immersive anatomical visualization. Our method combines streamed foveated path tracing with a lightweight Gaussian Splatting approximation of the periphery. The peripheral model generation is optimized with volume data and continuously refined using foveal renderings, enabling interactive updates. Depth-guided reprojection further improves robustness to latency and allows users to balance fidelity with refresh rate.
  We compare our method against direct path tracing and Gaussian Splatting. Our results highlight how their combination can preserve strengths in visual quality while re-generating the peripheral model in under a second, eliminating extensive preprocessing and approximations. This opens new options for interactive medical visualization.]]></description>

Evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) applications differs from traditional software testing because outputs are stochastic, high-dimensional, and sensitive to prompt and model changes. We present an evaluation-driven workflow - Define, Test, Diagnose, Fix - that turns these challenges into a repeatable engineering loop.
  We introduce the Minimum Viable Evaluation Suite (MVES), a tiered set of recommended evaluation components for (i) general LLM applications, (ii) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and (iii) agentic tool-use workflows. We also synthesize common evaluation methods (automated checks, human rubrics, and LLM-as-judge) and discuss known judge failure modes.
  In reproducible local experiments (Ollama; Llama 3 8B Instruct and Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct), we observe that a generic "improved" prompt template can trade off behaviors: on our small structured suites, extraction pass rate decreased from 100% to 90% and RAG compliance from 93.3% to 80% for Llama 3 when replacing task-specific prompts with generic rules, while instruction-following improved. These findings motivate evaluation-driven prompt iteration and careful claim calibration rather than universal prompt recipes.
  All test suites, harnesses, and results are included for reproducibility.]]></description>

The operation of future 6th-generation (6G) mobile networks will increasingly rely on the ability of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize network decisions in real-time. DRL yields demonstrated efficacy in various resource allocation problems, such as joint decisions on user scheduling and antenna allocation or simultaneous control of computing resources and modulation. However, trained DRL agents are closed-boxes and inherently difficult to explain, which hinders their adoption in production settings. In this paper, we make a step towards removing this critical barrier by presenting SymbXRL, a novel technique for explainable reinforcement learning (XRL) that synthesizes human-interpretable explanations for DRL agents. SymbXRL leverages symbolic AI to produce explanations where key concepts and their relationships are described via intuitive symbols and rules; coupling such a representation with logical reasoning exposes the decision process of DRL agents and offers more comprehensible descriptions of their behaviors compared to existing approaches. We validate SymbXRL in practical network management use cases supported by DRL, proving that it not only improves the semantics of the explanations but also paves the way for explicit agent control: for instance, it enables intent-based programmatic action steering that improves by 12% the median cumulative reward over a pure DRL solution.]]></description>

Unlearning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) prevents the model from revealing private information when queried about target images. Existing MLLM unlearning methods largely adopt approaches developed for LLMs. They treat all answer tokens uniformly, disregarding their varying importance in the unlearning process. Moreover, these methods focus exclusively on the language modality, disregarding visual cues that indicate key tokens in answers. In this paper, after formulating the problem of unlearning in multimodal question answering for MLLMs, we propose Visual-Guided Key-Token Regularization (ViKeR). We leverage irrelevant visual inputs to predict ideal post-unlearning token-level distributions and use these distributions to regularize the unlearning process, thereby prioritizing key tokens. Further, we define key tokens in unlearning via information entropy and discuss ViKeR's effectiveness through token-level gradient reweighting, which amplifies updates on key tokens. Experiments on MLLMU and CLEAR benchmarks demonstrate that our method effectively performs unlearning while mitigating forgetting and maintaining response coherence.]]></description>

The quality of machine learning models depends heavily on their training data. Selecting high-quality, diverse training sets for large language models (LLMs) is a difficult task, due to the lack of cheap and reliable quality metrics. While querying existing LLMs for document quality is common, this is not scalable to the large number (billions) of documents used in training. Instead, practitioners often use classifiers trained on sparse quality signals. In this paper, we propose a text-embedding-based hierarchical clustering approach that adaptively selects the documents to be evaluated by the LLM to estimate cluster quality. We prove that our method is query efficient: under the assumption that the hierarchical clustering contains a subtree such that each leaf cluster in the tree is pure enough (i.e., it mostly contains either only good or only bad documents), with high probability, the method can correctly predict the quality of each document after querying a small number of documents. The number of such documents is proportional to the size of the smallest subtree with (almost) pure leaves, without the algorithm knowing this subtree in advance. Furthermore, in a comprehensive experimental study, we demonstrate the benefits of our algorithm compared to other classifier-based filtering methods.]]></description>

Video storytelling is often constrained by available material, limiting creative expression and leaving undesired narrative gaps. Generative video offers a new way to address these limitations by augmenting captured media with tailored visuals. To explore this potential, we interviewed eight video creators to identify opportunities and challenges in integrating generative video into their workflows. Building on these insights and established filmmaking principles, we developed Vidmento, a tool for authoring hybrid video stories that combine captured and generated media through context-aware expansion. Vidmento surfaces opportunities for story development, generates clips that blend stylistically and narratively with surrounding media, and provides controls for refinement. In a study with 12 creators, Vidmento supported narrative development and exploration by systematically expanding initial materials with generative media, enabling expressive video storytelling aligned with creative intent. We highlight how creators bridge story gaps with generative content and where they find this blending capability most valuable.]]></description>

Catastrophic forgetting in continual learning is often measured at the performance or last-layer representation level, overlooking the underlying mechanisms. We introduce a mechanistic framework that offers a geometric interpretation of catastrophic forgetting as the result of transformations to the encoding of individual features. These transformations can lead to forgetting by reducing the allocated capacity of features (worse representation) and disrupting their readout by downstream computations. Analysis of a tractable model formalizes this view, allowing us to identify best- and worst-case scenarios. Through experiments on this model, we empirically test our formal analysis and highlight the detrimental effect of depth. Finally, we demonstrate how our framework can be used in the analysis of practical models through the use of Crosscoders. We present a case study of a Vision Transformer trained on sequential CIFAR-10. Our work provides a new, feature-centric vocabulary for continual learning.]]></description>

Language models often default to a narrow set of high-probability outputs, leaving their generation paths homogeneous and prone to mode collapse. Sampling-based strategies inject randomness but still struggle to guarantee diversity across multiple concurrent generation runs. We address this limitation by introducing STARS ($\textbf{St}$iefel-based $\textbf{A}$ctivation Steering for Diverse $\textbf{R}$ea$\textbf{S}$oning), a training-free, inference-time intervention method that transforms activation steering into an exploration engine. At each token, STARS collects the hidden activations of concurrent generation runs and optimizes multiple additive steering directions jointly on the Stiefel manifold. STARS maximizes the geometric volume of the steered activations, while the Stiefel manifold induces orthogonality of the steering interventions. This formulation explicitly promotes divergent activation vectors of concurrent generation runs, and implicitly promotes divergent generation trajectories. This manifold optimization formulation can be solved using a Riemannian gradient descent algorithm with convergence guarantees, but this algorithm is too time-consuming for real-time inference. To guarantee low latency, we further design a lightweight one-step update with an aggressive, closed-form stepsize. For test case generation and scientific discovery benchmarks, STARS consistently outperforms standard sampling methods, achieving greater diversity without sacrificing qualitative performance.]]></description>

In this work, we present Multimodal Equivariant Inverse Design Network (MEIDNet), a framework that jointly learns structural information and materials properties through contrastive learning, while encoding structures via an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN). By combining generative inverse design with multimodal learning, our approach accelerates the exploration of chemical-structural space and facilitates the discovery of materials that satisfy predefined property targets. MEIDNet exhibits strong latent-space alignment with cosine similarity 0.96 by fusion of three modalities through cross-modal learning. Through implementation of curriculum learning strategies, MEIDNet achieves ~60 times higher learning efficiency than conventional training techniques. The potential of our multimodal approach is demonstrated by generating low-bandgap perovskite structures at a stable, unique, and novel (SUN) rate of 13.6 %, which are further validated by ab initio methods. Our inverse design framework demonstrates both scalability and adaptability, paving the way for the universal learning of chemical space across diverse modalities.]]></description>

Distance metrics are central to machine learning, yet distances between ensembles of quantum states remain poorly understood due to fundamental quantum measurement constraints. We introduce a hierarchy of integral probability metrics, termed MMD-$k$, which generalizes the maximum mean discrepancy to quantum ensembles and exhibit a strict trade-off between discriminative power and statistical efficiency as the moment order $k$ increases. For pure-state ensembles of size $N$, estimating MMD-$k$ using experimentally feasible SWAP-test-based estimators requires $Θ(N^{2-2/k})$ samples for constant $k$, and $Θ(N^3)$ samples to achieve full discriminative power at $k = N$. In contrast, the quantum Wasserstein distance attains full discriminative power with $Θ(N^2 \log N)$ samples. These results provide principled guidance for the design of loss functions in quantum machine learning, which we illustrate in the training quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic models.]]></description>

The problem of optimising functions with intractable gradients frequently arise in machine learning and statistics, ranging from maximum marginal likelihood estimation procedures to fine-tuning of generative models. Stochastic approximation methods for this class of problems typically require inner sampling loops to obtain (biased) stochastic gradient estimates, which rapidly becomes computationally expensive. In this work, we develop sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers for optimisation of functions with intractable gradients. Our approach replaces expensive inner sampling methods with efficient SMC approximations, which can result in significant computational gains. We establish convergence results for the basic recursions defined by our methodology which SMC samplers approximate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the reward-tuning of energy-based models within various settings.]]></description>

Transformers achieve superior performance on many tasks, but impose heavy compute and memory requirements during inference. This inference can be made more efficient by partitioning the process across multiple devices, which, in turn, requires compressing its intermediate representations. In this work, we introduce a principled rate-distortion-based framework for lossy compression that learns compact encodings that explicitly trade off bitrate against accuracy. Experiments on language benchmarks show that the proposed codec achieves substantial savings with improved accuracy in some cases, outperforming more complex baseline methods. We characterize and analyze the rate-distortion performance of transformers, offering a unified lens for understanding performance in representation coding. This formulation extends information-theoretic concepts to define the gap between rate and entropy, and derive some of its bounds. We further develop probably approximately correct (PAC)-style bounds for estimating this gap. For different architectures and tasks, we empirically demonstrate that their rates are driven by these bounds, adding to the explainability of the formulation.]]></description>

AI agent inference is driving an inference heavy datacenter future and exposes bottlenecks beyond compute - especially memory capacity, memory bandwidth and high-speed interconnect. We introduce two metrics - Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF) - that jointly explain regimes the classic roofline analysis misses, including the memory capacity wall. Across agentic workflows (chat, coding, web use, computer use) and base model choices (GQA/MLA, MoE, quantization), OI/CF can shift dramatically, with long context KV cache making decode highly memory bound. These observations motivate disaggregated serving and system level heterogeneity: specialized prefill and decode accelerators, broader scale up networking, and decoupled compute-memory enabled by optical I/O. We further hypothesize agent-hardware co design, multiple inference accelerators within one system, and high bandwidth, large capacity memory disaggregation as foundations for adaptation to evolving OI/CF. Together, these directions chart a path to sustain efficiency and capability for large scale agentic AI inference.]]></description>

Imbalanced Domain Generalization (IDG) focuses on mitigating both domain and label shifts, both of which fundamentally shape the model's decision boundaries, particularly under heterogeneous long-tailed distributions across domains. Despite its practical significance, it remains underexplored, primarily due to the technical complexity of handling their entanglement and the paucity of theoretical foundations. In this paper, we begin by theoretically establishing the generalization bound for IDG, highlighting the role of posterior discrepancy and decision margin. This bound motivates us to focus on directly steering decision boundaries, marking a clear departure from existing methods. Subsequently, we technically propose a novel Negative-Dominant Contrastive Learning (NDCL) for IDG to enhance discriminability while enforce posterior consistency across domains. Specifically, inter-class decision-boundary separation is enhanced by placing greater emphasis on negatives as the primary signal in our contrastive learning, naturally amplifying gradient signals for minority classes to avoid the decision boundary being biased toward majority classes. Meanwhile, intra-class compactness is encouraged through a re-weighted cross-entropy strategy, and posterior consistency across domains is enforced through a prediction-central alignment strategy. Finally, rigorous yet challenging experiments on benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our NDCL. The code is available at https://github.com/Alrash/NDCL.]]></description>

This work highlights that video world modeling, alongside vision-language pre-training, establishes a fresh and independent foundation for robot learning. Intuitively, video world models provide the ability to imagine the near future by understanding the causality between actions and visual dynamics. Inspired by this, we introduce LingBot-VA, an autoregressive diffusion framework that learns frame prediction and policy execution simultaneously. Our model features three carefully crafted designs: (1) a shared latent space, integrating vision and action tokens, driven by a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, (2) a closed-loop rollout mechanism, allowing for ongoing acquisition of environmental feedback with ground-truth observations, (3) an asynchronous inference pipeline, parallelizing action prediction and motor execution to support efficient control. We evaluate our model on both simulation benchmarks and real-world scenarios, where it shows significant promise in long-horizon manipulation, data efficiency in post-training, and strong generalizability to novel configurations. The code and model are made publicly available to facilitate the community.]]></description>

While Mechanistic Interpretability has identified interpretable circuits in LLMs, their causal origins in training data remain elusive. We introduce Mechanistic Data Attribution (MDA), a scalable framework that employs Influence Functions to trace interpretable units back to specific training samples. Through extensive experiments on the Pythia family, we causally validate that targeted intervention--removing or augmenting a small fraction of high-influence samples--significantly modulates the emergence of interpretable heads, whereas random interventions show no effect. Our analysis reveals that repetitive structural data (e.g., LaTeX, XML) acts as a mechanistic catalyst. Furthermore, we observe that interventions targeting induction head formation induce a concurrent change in the model's in-context learning (ICL) capability. This provides direct causal evidence for the long-standing hypothesis regarding the functional link between induction heads and ICL. Finally, we propose a mechanistic data augmentation pipeline that consistently accelerates circuit convergence across model scales, providing a principled methodology for steering the developmental trajectories of LLMs.]]></description>

Contemporary software architectures struggle to support autonomous agents whose reasoning is adaptive, probabilistic, and context-dependent, while system integration remains dominated by static interfaces and deterministic contracts. This paper introduces Liquid Interfaces, a coordination paradigm in which interfaces are not persistent technical artifacts, but ephemeral relational events that emerge through intention articulation and semantic negotiation at runtime.We formalize this model and present the Liquid Interface Protocol (LIP),which governs intention-driven interaction, negotiated execution, and enforce ephemerality under semantic uncertainty. We further discuss the governance implications of this approach and describe a reference architecture that demonstrates practical feasibility. Liquid Interfaces provide a principled foundation for adaptive coordination in agent-based systems]]></description>

Real-world reinforcement learning is often \emph{nonstationary}: rewards and dynamics drift, accelerate, oscillate, and trigger abrupt switches in the optimal action. Existing theory often represents nonstationarity with coarse-scale models that measure \emph{how much} the environment changes, not \emph{how} it changes locally -- even though acceleration and near-ties drive tracking error and policy chattering. We take a geometric view of nonstationary discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by modeling the environment as a differentiable homotopy path and tracking the induced motion of the optimal Bellman fixed point. This yields a length--curvature--kink signature of intrinsic complexity: cumulative drift, acceleration/oscillation, and action-gap-induced nonsmoothness. We prove a solver-agnostic path-integral stability bound and derive gap-safe feasible regions that certify local stability away from switch regimes. Building on these results, we introduce \textit{Homotopy-Tracking RL (HT-RL)} and \textit{HT-MCTS}, lightweight wrappers that estimate replay-based proxies of length, curvature, and near-tie proximity online and adapt learning or planning intensity accordingly. Experiments show improved tracking and dynamic regret over matched static baselines, with the largest gains in oscillatory and switch-prone regimes.]]></description>

We present a batched first-order method for solving multiple linear programs in parallel on GPUs. Our approach extends the primal-dual hybrid gradient algorithm to efficiently solve batches of related linear programming problems that arise in mixed-integer programming techniques such as strong branching and bound tightening. By leveraging matrix-matrix operations instead of repeated matrix-vector operations, we obtain significant computational advantages on GPU architectures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various case studies and identify the problem sizes where first-order methods outperform traditional simplex-based solvers depending on the computational environment one can use. This is a significant step for the design and development of integer programming algorithms tightly exploiting GPU capabilities where we argue that some specific operations should be allocated to GPUs and performed in full instead of using light-weight heuristic approaches on CPUs.]]></description>

An agent operating in an unknown dynamical system must learn its dynamics from observations. Active information gathering accelerates this learning, but existing methods derive bespoke costs for specific modeling choices: dynamics models, belief update procedures, observation models, and planners. We present a unifying framework that decouples these choices from the information-gathering cost by explicitly exposing the causal dependencies between parameters, beliefs, and controls. Using this framework, we derive a general information-gathering cost based on Massey's directed information that assumes only Markov dynamics with additive noise and is otherwise agnostic to modeling choices. We prove that the mutual information cost used in existing literature is a special case of our cost. Then, we leverage our framework to establish an explicit connection between the mutual information cost and information gain in linearized Bayesian estimation, thereby providing theoretical justification for mutual information-based active learning approaches. Finally, we illustrate the practical utility of our framework through experiments spanning linear, nonlinear, and multi-agent systems.]]></description>

Generative models for 3D molecular conformations must respect Euclidean symmetries and concentrate probability mass on thermodynamically favorable, mechanically stable structures. However, E(3)-equivariant diffusion models often reproduce biases from semi-empirical training data rather than capturing the equilibrium distribution of a high-fidelity Hamiltonian. While physics-based guidance can correct this, it faces two computational bottlenecks: expensive quantum-chemical evaluations (e.g., DFT) and the need to repeat such queries at every sampling step. We present Elign, a post-training framework that amortizes both costs. First, we replace expensive DFT evaluations with a faster, pretrained foundational machine-learning force field (MLFF) to provide physical signals. Second, we eliminate repeated run-time queries by shifting physical steering to the training phase. To achieve the second amortization, we formulate reverse diffusion as a reinforcement learning problem and introduce Force--Energy Disentangled Group Relative Policy Optimization (FED-GRPO) to fine-tune the denoising policy. FED-GRPO includes a potential-based energy reward and a force-based stability reward, which are optimized and group-normalized independently. Experiments show that Elign generates conformations with lower gold-standard DFT energies and forces, while improving stability. Crucially, inference remains as fast as unguided sampling, since no energy evaluations are required during generation.]]></description>

Discovering superior circuit topologies requires navigating an exponentially large design space-a challenge traditionally reserved for human experts. Existing AI methods either select from predefined templates or generate novel topologies at a limited scale without rigorous verification, leaving large-scale performance-driven discovery underexplored. We present PowerGenie, a framework for automated discovery of higher-performance reconfigurable power converters at scale. PowerGenie introduces: (1) an automated analytical framework that determines converter functionality and theoretical performance limits without component sizing or SPICE simulation, and (2) an evolutionary finetuning method that co-evolves a generative model with its training distribution through fitness selection and uniqueness verification. Unlike existing methods that suffer from mode collapse and overfitting, our approach achieves higher syntax validity, function validity, novelty rate, and figure-of-merit (FoM). PowerGenie discovers a novel 8-mode reconfigurable converter with 23% higher FoM than the best training topology. SPICE simulations confirm average absolute efficiency gains of 10% across 8 modes and up to 17% at a single mode. Code is available at https://github.com/xz-group/PowerGenie.]]></description>

Bayesian inference allows us to define a posterior distribution over the weights of a generic neural network (NN). Exact posteriors are usually intractable, in which case approximations can be employed. One such approximation - variational inference - is computationally efficient when using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent as subsets of the data are used for likelihood and gradient evaluations, though the approach relies on the selection of a variational distribution which sufficiently matches the form of the posterior. Particle-based methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo and Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) do not assume a parametric family for the posterior by typically require higher computational cost. These sampling methods typically use the full-batch of data for likelihood and gradient evaluations, which contributes to this computational expense. We explore several methods of gradually introducing more mini-batches of data (data annealing) into likelihood and gradient evaluations of an SMC sampler. We find that we can achieve up to $6\times$ faster training with minimal loss in accuracy on benchmark image classification problems using NNs.]]></description>

Event stream data is a critical resource for fine-grained analysis across various domains, including financial transactions, system operations, and sports. In sports, it is actively used for fine-grained analyses such as quantifying player contributions and identifying tactical patterns. However, the reliability of these models is fundamentally limited by inherent data quality issues that cause logical inconsistencies (e.g., incorrect event ordering or missing events). To this end, this study proposes VERSA (Verified Event Data Format for Reliable Soccer Analytics), a systematic verification framework that ensures the integrity of event stream data within the soccer domain. VERSA is based on a state-transition model that defines valid event sequences, thereby enabling the automatic detection and correction of anomalous patterns within the event stream data. Notably, our examination of event data from the K League 1 (2024 season), provided by Bepro, detected that 18.81% of all recorded events exhibited logical inconsistencies. Addressing such integrity issues, our experiments demonstrate that VERSA significantly enhances cross-provider consistency, ensuring stable and unified data representation across heterogeneous sources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that data refined by VERSA significantly improves the robustness and performance of a downstream task called VAEP, which evaluates player contributions. These results highlight that the verification process is highly effective in increasing the reliability of data-driven analysis.]]></description>

Feature embeddings acquired from pretrained models are widely used in medical applications of deep learning to assess the characteristics of datasets; e.g. to determine the quality of synthetic, generated medical images. The Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) is one popular synthetic image quality metric that relies on the assumption that the characteristic features of the data can be detected and encoded by an InceptionV3 model pretrained on ImageNet1K (natural images). While it is widely known that this makes it less effective for applications involving medical images, the extent to which the metric fails to capture meaningful differences in image characteristics is not obviously known. Here, we use Monte Carlo dropout to compute the predictive variance in the FID as well as a supplemental estimate of the predictive variance in the feature embedding model's latent representations. We show that the magnitudes of the predictive variances considered exhibit varying degrees of correlation with the extent to which test inputs (ImageNet1K validation set augmented at various strengths, and other external datasets) are out-of-distribution relative to its training data, providing some insight into the effectiveness of their use as indicators of the trustworthiness of the FID.]]></description>

Temporal knowledge graph reasoning (TKGR) aims to predict future events by inferring missing entities with dynamic knowledge structures. Existing LLM-based reasoning methods prioritize contextual over structural relations, struggling to extract relevant subgraphs from dynamic graphs. This limits structural information understanding, leading to unstructured, hallucination-prone inferences especially with temporal inconsistencies. To address this problem, we propose IGETR (Integration of Graph and Editing-enhanced Temporal Reasoning), a hybrid reasoning framework that combines the structured temporal modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the contextual understanding of LLMs. IGETR operates through a three-stage pipeline. The first stage aims to ground the reasoning process in the actual data by identifying structurally and temporally coherent candidate paths through a temporal GNN, ensuring that inference starts from reliable graph-based evidence. The second stage introduces LLM-guided path editing to address logical and semantic inconsistencies, leveraging external knowledge to refine and enhance the initial paths. The final stage focuses on integrating the refined reasoning paths to produce predictions that are both accurate and interpretable. Experiments on standard TKG benchmarks show that IGETR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines with relative improvements of up to 5.6% on Hits@1 and 8.1% on Hits@3 on the challenging ICEWS datasets. Additionally, we execute ablation studies and additional analyses confirm the effectiveness of each component.]]></description>

Traditional architectural simulations (e.g. Computational Fluid Dynamics, evacuation, structural analysis) model elements as deterministic physics-based "particles" rather than cognitive "agents". To bridge this, we introduce \textbf{Agentic Environmental Simulations}, where Large Multimodal generative models actively predict the next state of spatial environments based on semantic expectation. Drawing on examples from accessibility-oriented AR pipelines and multimodal digital twins, we propose a shift from chronological time-steps to Episodic Spatial Reasoning, where simulations advance through meaningful, surprisal-triggered events. Within this framework we posit AI hallucinations as diagnostic tools. By formalizing the \textbf{Cognitive Friction} ($C_f$) it is possible to reveal "Phantom Affordances", i.e. semiotic ambiguities in built space. Finally, we challenge current HCI paradigms by treating environments as dynamic cognitive partners and propose a human-centered framework of cognitive orchestration for designing AI-driven simulations that preserve autonomy, affective clarity, and cognitive integrity.]]></description>

Recent work identifies a stated-revealed (SvR) preference gap in language models (LMs): a mismatch between the values models endorse and the choices they make in context. Existing evaluations rely heavily on binary forced-choice prompting, which entangles genuine preferences with artifacts of the elicitation protocol. We systematically study how elicitation protocols affect SvR correlation across 24 LMs. Allowing neutrality and abstention during stated preference elicitation allows us to exclude weak signals, substantially improving Spearman's rank correlation ($ρ$) between volunteered stated preferences and forced-choice revealed preferences. However, further allowing abstention in revealed preferences drives $ρ$ to near-zero or negative values due to high neutrality rates. Finally, we find that system prompt steering using stated preferences during revealed preference elicitation does not reliably improve SvR correlation on AIRiskDilemmas. Together, our results show that SvR correlation is highly protocol-dependent and that preference elicitation requires methods that account for indeterminate preferences.]]></description>

Recent work has explored optimizing LLM collaboration through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \textbf{C}entralized \textbf{C}ritic and \textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \textbf{D}ecentralized \textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge. Our code is available at https://github.com/OpenMLRL/CoMLRL/releases/tag/v1.3.2.]]></description>

Imitation learning has achieved remarkable success in robotic manipulation, yet its application to surgical robotics remains challenging due to data scarcity, constrained workspaces, and the need for an exceptional level of safety and predictability. We present a supervised Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed for phase-structured surgical manipulation tasks, which can be added on top of any autonomous policy. Unlike prior surgical robot learning approaches that rely on multi-camera setups or thousands of demonstrations, we show that a lightweight action decoder policy like Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) can learn complex, long-horizon manipulation from less than 150 demonstrations using solely stereo endoscopic images, when equipped with our architecture. We evaluate our approach on the collaborative surgical task of bowel grasping and retraction, where a robot assistant interprets visual cues from a human surgeon, executes targeted grasping on deformable tissue, and performs sustained retraction. We benchmark our method against state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and the standard ACT baseline. Our results show that generalist VLAs fail to acquire the task entirely, even under standard in-distribution conditions. Furthermore, while standard ACT achieves moderate success in-distribution, adopting a supervised MoE architecture significantly boosts its performance, yielding higher success rates in-distribution and demonstrating superior robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, including novel grasp locations, reduced illumination, and partial occlusions. Notably, it generalizes to unseen testing viewpoints and also transfers zero-shot to ex vivo porcine tissue without additional training, offering a promising pathway toward in vivo deployment. To support this, we present qualitative preliminary results of policy roll-outs during in vivo porcine surgery.]]></description>

Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate, generating content inconsistent with the input. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) can mitigate hallucinations but require resource-intensive retrieval or large-scale fine-tuning. Decoding-based methods are lighter yet lack explicit hallucination control. To address this, we present Token-Guard, a token-level hallucination control method based on self-checking decoding. Token-Guard performs internal verification at each reasoning step to detect hallucinated tokens before they propagate. Candidate fragments are further evaluated in a latent space with explicit hallucination risk scoring, while iterative pruning and regeneration dynamically correct detected errors. Experiments on HALU datasets show Token-Guard substantially reduces hallucinations and improves generation accuracy, offering a scalable, modular solution for reliable LLM outputs. Our code is publicly available.]]></description>

Knowledge distillation offers a promising path to transfer reasoning capabilities from large teacher models to efficient student models; however, existing token-level on-policy distillation methods require token-level alignment between the student and teacher models, which restricts the student model's exploration ability, prevent effective use of interactive environment feedback, and suffer from severe memory bottlenecks in reinforcement learning. We introduce On-policy Verbal Distillation (OVD), a memory-efficient framework that replaces token-level probability matching with trajectory matching using discrete verbal scores (0--9) from teacher models. OVD dramatically reduces memory consumption while enabling on-policy distillation from teacher models with verbal feedback, and avoids token-level alignment, allowing the student model to freely explore the output space. Extensive experiments on Web question answering and mathematical reasoning tasks show that OVD substantially outperforms existing methods, delivering up to +12.9% absolute improvement in average EM on Web Q&A tasks and a up to +25.7% gain on math benchmarks (when trained with only one random samples), while also exhibiting superior training efficiency.

AI research has traditionally prioritised algorithmic performance, such as optimising accuracy in machine learning or runtime in automated planning. The emerging paradigm of Green AI challenges this by recognising energy consumption as a critical performance dimension. Despite the high computational demands of automated planning, its energy efficiency has received little attention. This gap is particularly salient given the modular planning structure, in which domain models are specified independently of algorithms. On the other hand, this separation also enables systematic analysis of energy usage through domain model design. We empirically investigate how domain model characteristics affect the energy consumption of classical planners. We introduce a domain model configuration framework that enables controlled variation of features, such as element ordering, action arity, and dead-end states. Using five benchmark domains and five state-of-the-art planners, we analyse energy and runtime impacts across 32 domain variants per benchmark. Results demonstrate that domain-level modifications produce measurable energy differences across planners, with energy consumption not always correlating with runtime.]]></description>

Drug discovery can be viewed as a combinatorial search over an immense chemical space, motivating the development of deep generative models for de novo molecular design. Among these, GPT-based molecular language models (MLM) have shown strong molecular design performance by learning chemical syntax and semantics from large-scale data. However, existing MLMs face two fundamental limitations: they inadequately capture the graph-structured nature of molecules when formulated as next-token prediction problems, and they typically lack explicit mechanisms for target-aware generation. Here, we propose SoftMol, a unified framework that co-designs molecular representation, model architecture, and search strategy for target-aware molecular generation. SoftMol introduces soft fragments, a rule-free block representation of SMILES that enables diffusion-native modeling, and develops SoftBD, the first block-diffusion molecular language model that combines local bidirectional diffusion with autoregressive generation under molecular structural constraints. To favor generated molecules with high drug-likeness and synthetic accessibility, SoftBD is trained on a carefully curated dataset named ZINC-Curated. SoftMol further integrates a gated Monte Carlo tree search to assemble fragments in a target-aware manner. Experimental results show that, compared with current state-of-the-art models, SoftMol achieves 100% chemical validity, improves binding affinity by 9.7%, yields a 2-3x increase in molecular diversity, and delivers a 6.6x speedup in inference efficiency.

Generative AI and misinformation research has evolved since our 2024 survey. This paper presents an updated perspective, transitioning from literature review to practical countermeasures. We report on changes in the threat landscape, including improved AI-generated content through Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal systems. Central to this work are our practical contributions: JudgeGPT, a platform for evaluating human perception of AI-generated news, and RogueGPT, a controlled stimulus generation engine for research. Together, these tools form an experimental pipeline for studying how humans perceive and detect AI-generated misinformation. Our findings show that detection capabilities have improved, but the competition between generation and detection continues. We discuss mitigation strategies including LLM-based detection, inoculation approaches, and the dual-use nature of generative AI. This work contributes to research addressing the adverse impacts of AI on information quality.]]></description>

Web agents have demonstrated strong performance on a wide range of web-based tasks. However, existing research on the effect of environmental variation has mostly focused on robustness to adversarial attacks, with less attention to agents' preferences in benign scenarios. Although early studies have examined how textual attributes influence agent behavior, a systematic understanding of how visual attributes shape agent decision-making remains limited. To address this, we introduce VAF, a controlled evaluation pipeline for quantifying how webpage Visual Attribute Factors influence web-agent decision-making. Specifically, VAF consists of three stages: (i) variant generation, which ensures the variants share identical semantics as the original item while only differ in visual attributes; (ii) browsing interaction, where agents navigate the page via scrolling and clicking the interested item, mirroring how human users browse online; (iii) validating through both click action and reasoning from agents, which we use the Target Click Rate and Target Mention Rate to jointly evaluate the effect of visual attributes. By quantitatively measuring the decision-making difference between the original and variant, we identify which visual attributes influence agents' behavior most. Extensive experiments, across 8 variant families (48 variants total), 5 real-world websites (including shopping, travel, and news browsing), and 4 representative web agents, show that background color contrast, item size, position, and card clarity have a strong influence on agents' actions, whereas font styling, text color, and item image clarity exhibit minor effects.]]></description>

We develop a near-optimal testing procedure under the framework of Gaussian differential privacy for simple as well as one- and two-sided tests under monotone likelihood ratio conditions. Our mechanism is based on a private mean estimator with data-driven clamping bounds, whose population risk matches the private minimax rate up to logarithmic factors. Using this estimator, we construct private test statistics that achieve the same asymptotic relative efficiency as the non-private, most powerful tests while maintaining conservative type I error control. In addition to our theoretical results, our numerical experiments show that our private tests outperform competing DP methods and offer comparable power to the non-private most powerful tests, even at moderately small sample sizes and privacy loss budgets.]]></description>

We introduce PaddleOCR-VL-1.5, an upgraded model achieving a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy of 94.5% on OmniDocBench v1.5. To rigorously evaluate robustness against real-world physical distortions, including scanning, skew, warping, screen-photography, and illumination, we propose the Real5-OmniDocBench benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that this enhanced model attains SOTA performance on the newly curated benchmark. Furthermore, we extend the model's capabilities by incorporating seal recognition and text spotting tasks, while remaining a 0.9B ultra-compact VLM with high efficiency.

Data-based optimization (DBO) offers a promising approach for efficiently optimizing shape for better aerodynamic performance by leveraging a pretrained surrogate model for offline evaluations during iterations. However, DBO heavily relies on the quality of the training database. Samples outside the training distribution encountered during optimization can lead to significant prediction errors, potentially misleading the optimization process. Therefore, incorporating uncertainty quantification into optimization is critical for detecting outliers and enhancing robustness. This study proposes an uncertainty-aware data-based optimization (UA-DBO) framework to monitor and minimize surrogate model uncertainty during DBO. A probabilistic encoder-decoder surrogate model is developed to predict uncertainties associated with its outputs, and these uncertainties are integrated into a model-confidence-aware objective function to penalize samples with large prediction errors during data-based optimization process. The UA-DBO framework is evaluated on two multipoint optimization problems aimed at improving airfoil drag divergence and buffet performance. Results demonstrate that UA-DBO consistently reduces prediction errors in optimized samples and achieves superior performance gains compared to original DBO. Moreover, compared to multipoint optimization based on full computational simulations, UA-DBO offers comparable optimization effectiveness while significantly accelerating optimization speed.]]></description>

The increasing availability of unstructured clinical narratives in electronic health records (EHRs) has created new opportunities for automated disease characterization, cohort identification, and clinical decision support. However, modeling long, domain-specific clinical text remains challenging due to limited labeled data, severe class imbalance, and the high computational cost of adapting large pretrained language models.
  This study presents a GPT-based architecture for clinical text classification that adapts a pretrained decoder-only Transformer using a selective fine-tuning strategy. Rather than updating all model parameters, the majority of the GPT-2 backbone is frozen, and training is restricted to the final Transformer block, the final layer normalization, and a lightweight classification head. This approach substantially reduces the number of trainable parameters while preserving the representational capacity required to model complex clinical language.
  The proposed method is evaluated on radiology reports from the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset using uncertainty-aware CheXpert-style labels derived directly from report text. Experiments cover multiple problem formulations, including multi-label classification of radiographic findings, binary per-label classification under different uncertainty assumptions, and aggregate disease outcome prediction. Across varying dataset sizes, the model exhibits stable convergence behavior and strong classification performance, particularly in settings dominated by non-mention and negated findings.
  Overall, the results indicate that selective fine-tuning of pretrained generative language models provides an efficient and effective pathway for clinical text classification, enabling scalable adaptation to real-world EHR data while significantly reducing computational complexity.]]></description>

We develop a diffusion-based sampler for target distributions known up to a normalising constant. To this end, we rely on the well-known diffusion path that smoothly interpolates between a (simple) base distribution and the target distribution, widely used in diffusion models. Our approach is based on a practical implementation of diffusion-annealed Langevin Monte Carlo, which approximates the diffusion path with convergence guarantees. We tackle the score estimation problem by developing an efficient sequential Monte Carlo sampler that evolves auxiliary variables from conditional distributions along the path, which provides principled score estimates for time-varying distributions. We further develop novel control variate schedules that minimise the variance of these score estimates. Finally, we provide theoretical guarantees and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several synthetic and real-world datasets.]]></description>

Medical multimodal learning faces significant challenges with missing modalities prevalent in clinical practice. Existing approaches assume equal contribution of modality and random missing patterns, neglecting inherent uncertainty in medical data acquisition. In this regard, we propose the Aleatoric Uncertainty Modeling (AUM) that explicitly quantifies unimodal aleatoric uncertainty to address missing modalities. Specifically, AUM models each unimodal representation as a multivariate Gaussian distribution to capture aleatoric uncertainty and enable principled modality reliability quantification. To adaptively aggregate captured information, we develop a dynamic message-passing mechanism within a bipartite patient-modality graph using uncertainty-aware aggregation mechanism. Through this process, missing modalities are naturally accommodated, while more reliable information from available modalities is dynamically emphasized to guide representation generation. Our AUM framework achieves an improvement of 2.26% AUC-ROC on MIMIC-IV mortality prediction and 2.17% gain on eICU, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.]]></description>

Neural visual decoding is a central problem in brain computer interface research, aiming to reconstruct human visual perception and to elucidate the structure of neural representations. However, existing approaches overlook a fundamental granularity mismatch between human and machine vision, where deep vision models emphasize semantic invariance by suppressing local texture information, whereas neural signals preserve an intricate mixture of low-level visual attributes and high-level semantic content. To address this mismatch, we propose Shallow Alignment, a novel contrastive learning strategy that aligns neural signals with intermediate representations of visual encoders rather than their final outputs, thereby striking a better balance between low-level texture details and high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Shallow Alignment significantly outperforms standard final-layer alignment, with performance gains ranging from 22% to 58% across diverse vision backbones. Notably, our approach effectively unlocks the scaling law in neural visual decoding, enabling decoding performance to scale predictably with the capacity of pre-trained vision backbones. We further conduct systematic empirical analyses to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the observed performance gains.]]></description>

Prevalent retrieval-based tool-use pipelines struggle with a dual semantic challenge: their retrievers often employ encoders that fail to capture complex semantics, while the Large Language Model (LLM) itself lacks intrinsic tool knowledge from its natural language pretraining. Generative methods offer a powerful alternative by unifying selection and execution, tasking the LLM to directly learn and generate tool identifiers. However, the common practice of mapping each tool to a unique new token introduces substantial limitations: it creates a scalability and generalization crisis, as the vocabulary size explodes and each tool is assigned a semantically isolated token. This approach also creates a semantic bottleneck that hinders the learning of collaborative tool relationships, as the model must infer them from sparse co-occurrences of monolithic tool IDs within a vast library. To address these limitations, we propose ToolWeaver, a novel generative tool learning framework that encodes tools into hierarchical sequences. This approach makes vocabulary expansion logarithmic to the number of tools. Crucially, it enables the model to learn collaborative patterns from the dense co-occurrence of shared codes, rather than the sparse co-occurrence of monolithic tool IDs. We generate these structured codes through a novel tokenization process designed to weave together a tool's intrinsic semantics with its extrinsic co-usage patterns. These structured codes are then integrated into the LLM through a generative alignment stage, where the model is fine-tuned to produce the hierarchical code sequences. Evaluation results with nearly 47,000 tools show that ToolWeaver significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a more scalable, generalizable, and semantically-aware foundation for advanced tool-augmented agents.]]></description>

The rapid rise of artificial intelligence has led to an unsustainable growth in energy consumption. This has motivated progress in neuromorphic computing and physics-based training of learning machines as alternatives to digital neural networks. Many theoretical studies focus on simple architectures like all-to-all or densely connected layered networks. However, these may be challenging to realize experimentally, e.g. due to connectivity constraints. In this work, we investigate the performance of the widespread physics-based training method of equilibrium propagation for more realistic architectural choices, specifically, locally connected lattices. We train an XY model and explore the influence of architecture on various benchmark tasks, tracking the evolution of spatially distributed responses and couplings during training. Our results show that sparse networks with only local connections can achieve performance comparable to dense networks. Our findings provide guidelines for further scaling up architectures based on equilibrium propagation in realistic settings.]]></description>

The widespread adoption of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across fields has amplified concerns about model interpretability. Distressingly, these models are often treated as black-boxes, with limited or non-existent investigation of their decision making process. Despite numerous post- and ante-hoc interepretability methods, systematic and objective evaluation of the learned representations remains limited, particularly for sparsity-aware methods that are increasingly considered to "induce interpretability". In this work, we focus on Concept Bottleneck Models and investigate how different modeling decisions affect the emerging representations. We introduce the notion of clarity, a measure, capturing the interplay between the downstream performance and the sparsity and precision of the concept representation, while proposing an interpretability assessment framework using datasets with ground truth concept annotations. We consider both VLM- and attribute predictor-based CBMs, and three different sparsity-inducing strategies: per example $\ell_1, \ell_0$ and Bernoulli-based formulations. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off between flexibility and interpretability, under which a given method can exhibit markedly different behaviors even at comparable performance levels. The code will be made publicly available upon publication.]]></description>

Diffusion generative models synthesize samples by discretizing reverse-time dynamics driven by a learned score (or denoiser). Existing convergence analyses of diffusion models typically scale at least linearly with the ambient dimension, and sharper rates often depend on intrinsic-dimension assumptions or other geometric restrictions on the target distribution. We develop an alternative, information-theoretic approach to dimension-free convergence that avoids any geometric assumptions. Under mild assumptions on the target distribution, we bound KL divergence between the target and generated distributions by $O(H^2/K)$ (up to endpoint factors), where $H$ is the Shannon entropy and $K$ is the number of sampling steps. Moreover, using a reformulation of the KL divergence, we propose a Loss-Adaptive Schedule (LAS) for efficient discretization of reverse SDE which is lightweight and relies only on the training loss, requiring no post-training heavy computation. Empirically, LAS improves sampling quality over common heuristic schedules.]]></description>

Transformers have revolutionized deep learning across various domains but understanding the precise token dynamics remains a theoretical challenge. Existing theories of deep Transformers with layer normalization typically predict that tokens cluster to a single point; however, these results rely on deterministic weight assumptions, which fail to capture the standard initialization scheme in Transformers. In this work, we show that accounting for the intrinsic stochasticity of random initialization alters this picture. More precisely, we analyze deep Transformers where noise arises from the random initialization of value matrices. Under diffusion scaling and token-wise RMS normalization, we prove that, as the number of Transformer layers goes to infinity, the discrete token dynamics converge to an interacting-particle system on the sphere where tokens are driven by a \emph{common} matrix-valued Brownian noise. In this limit, we show that initialization noise prevents the collapse to a single cluster predicted by deterministic models. For two tokens, we prove a phase transition governed by the interaction strength and the token dimension: unlike deterministic attention flows, antipodal configurations become attracting with positive probability. Numerical experiments confirm the predicted transition, reveal that antipodal formations persist for more than two tokens, and demonstrate that suppressing the intrinsic noise degrades accuracy.]]></description>

Medical multimodal representation learning aims to integrate heterogeneous data into unified patient representations to support clinical outcome prediction. However, real-world medical datasets commonly contain systematic biases from multiple sources, which poses significant challenges for medical multimodal representation learning. Existing approaches typically focus on effective multimodal fusion, neglecting inherent biased features that affect the generalization ability. To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-Stream Feature Decorrelation Framework that identifies and handles the biases through structural causal analysis introduced by latent confounders. Our method employs a causal-biased decorrelation framework with dual-stream neural networks to disentangle causal features from spurious correlations, utilizing generalized cross-entropy loss and mutual information minimization for effective decorrelation. The framework is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing medical multimodal learning methods. Comprehensive experiments on MIMIC-IV, eICU, and ADNI datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements.]]></description>

Book image rectification presents unique challenges in document image processing due to complex geometric distortions from binding constraints, where left and right pages exhibit distinctly asymmetric curvature patterns. However, existing single-page document image rectification methods fail to capture the coupled geometric relationships between adjacent pages in books. In this work, we introduce BookNet, the first end-to-end deep learning framework specifically designed for dual-page book image rectification. BookNet adopts a dual-branch architecture with cross-page attention mechanisms, enabling it to estimate warping flows for both individual pages and the complete book spread, explicitly modeling how left and right pages influence each other. Moreover, to address the absence of specialized datasets, we present Book3D, a large-scale synthetic dataset for training, and Book100, a comprehensive real-world benchmark for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BookNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on book image rectification. Code and dataset will be made publicly available.]]></description>

Despite strong performance on existing benchmarks, it remains unclear whether large language models can reason over genuinely novel scientific information. Most evaluations score end-to-end RAG pipelines, where reasoning is confounded with retrieval and toolchain choices, and the signal is further contaminated by parametric memorization and open-web volatility. We introduce DeR2, a controlled deep-research sandbox that isolates document-grounded reasoning while preserving core difficulties of deep search: multi-step synthesis, denoising, and evidence-based conclusion making. DeR2 decouples evidence access from reasoning via four regimes--Instruction-only, Concepts (gold concepts without documents), Related-only (only relevant documents), and Full-set (relevant documents plus topically related distractors)--yielding interpretable regime gaps that operationalize retrieval loss vs. reasoning loss and enable fine-grained error attribution. To prevent parametric leakage, we apply a two-phase validation that requires parametric failure without evidence while ensuring oracle-concept solvability. To ensure reproducibility, each instance provides a frozen document library (drawn from 2023-2025 theoretical papers) with expert-annotated concepts and validated rationales. Experiments across a diverse set of state-of-the-art foundation models reveal substantial variation and significant headroom: some models exhibit mode-switch fragility, performing worse with the Full-set than with Instruction-only, while others show structural concept misuse, correctly naming concepts but failing to execute them as procedures.]]></description>

We introduce AgenticSimLaw, a role-structured, multi-agent debate framework that provides transparent and controllable test-time reasoning for high-stakes tabular decision-making tasks. Unlike black-box approaches, our courtroom-style orchestration explicitly defines agent roles (prosecutor, defense, judge), interaction protocols (7-turn structured debate), and private reasoning strategies, creating a fully auditable decision-making process. We benchmark this framework on young adult recidivism prediction using the NLSY97 dataset, comparing it against traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across almost 90 unique combinations of models and strategies. Our results demonstrate that structured multi-agent debate provides more stable and generalizable performance compared to single-agent reasoning, with stronger correlation between accuracy and F1-score metrics. Beyond performance improvements, AgenticSimLaw offers fine-grained control over reasoning steps, generates complete interaction transcripts for explainability, and enables systematic profiling of agent behaviors. While we instantiate this framework in the criminal justice domain to stress-test reasoning under ethical complexity, the approach generalizes to any deliberative, high-stakes decision task requiring transparency and human oversight. This work addresses key LLM-based multi-agent system challenges: organization through structured roles, observability through logged interactions, and responsibility through explicit non-deployment constraints for sensitive domains.

Deep visual features are increasingly used as the interface in vision systems, motivating the need to describe feature characteristics and control feature quality for machine perception. Just noticeable difference (JND) characterizes the maximum imperceptible distortion for images under human or machine vision. Extending it to deep visual features naturally meets the above demand by providing a task-aligned tolerance boundary in feature space, offering a practical reference for controlling feature quality under constrained resources. We propose FeatJND, a task-aligned JND formulation that predicts the maximum tolerable per-feature perturbation map while preserving downstream task performance. We propose a FeatJND estimator at standardized split points and validate it across image classification, detection, and instance segmentation. Under matched distortion strength, FeatJND-based distortions consistently preserve higher task performance than unstructured Gaussian perturbations, and attribution visualizations suggest FeatJND can suppress non-critical feature regions. As an application, we further apply FeatJND to token-wise dynamic quantization and show that FeatJND-guided step-size allocation yields clear gains over random step-size permutation and global uniform step size under the same noise budget. Our code will be released after publication.]]></description>

Training data attribution (TDA) identifies which training examples most influenced a model's prediction. The best-performing TDA methods exploits gradients to define an influence function. To overcome the scalability challenge arising from gradient computation, the most popular strategy is random projection (e.g., TRAK, LoGRA). However, this still faces two bottlenecks when scaling to large training sets and high-quality attribution: \emph{(i)} storing and loading projected per-example gradients for all $N$ training examples, where query latency is dominated by I/O; and \emph{(ii)} forming the $D \times D$ inverse Hessian approximation, which costs $O(D^2)$ memory. Both bottlenecks scale with the projection dimension $D$, yet increasing $D$ is necessary for attribution quality -- creating a quality--scalability tradeoff. We introduce \textbf{LoRIF (Low-Rank Influence Functions)}, which exploits low-rank structures of gradient to address both bottlenecks. First, we store rank-$c$ factors of the projected per-example gradients rather than full matrices, reducing storage and query-time I/O from $O(D)$ to $O(c\sqrt{D})$ per layer per sample. Second, we use truncated SVD with the Woodbury identity to approximate the Hessian term in an $r$-dimensional subspace, reducing memory from $O(D^2)$ to $O(Dr)$. On models from 0.1B to 70B parameters trained on datasets with millions of examples, LoRIF achieves up to 20$\times$ storage reduction and query-time speedup compared to LoGRA, while matching or exceeding its attribution quality. LoRIF makes gradient-based TDA practical at frontier scale.]]></description>

The linear growth of Key-Value (KV) cache remains a bottleneck for multi-turn LLM deployment. Existing KV cache compression methods often fail to account for the structural properties of multi-turn dialogues, relying on heuristic eviction that risks losing critical context. We propose \textbf{SONIC}, a learning-based framework that compresses historical segments into compact and semantically rich \textbf{Nexus} tokens. By integrating dynamic budget training, SONIC allows flexible adaptation to varying memory constraints without retraining. Experiments show that at compression ratios of 80\% and 50\%, SONIC consistently outperforms baselines such as H2O and StreamingLLM on four diverse multi-turn benchmarks. Specifically, on the widely used MTBench101 benchmark, SONIC achieves an average score improvement of 35.55\% over state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness in sustaining coherent multi-turn dialogues. Furthermore, SONIC enhances deployment efficiency, accelerating the overall inference process by 50.1\% compared to full-context generation.]]></description>

We study online transfer reinforcement learning (RL) in episodic Markov decision processes, where experience from related source tasks is available during learning on a target task. A fundamental difficulty is that task similarity is typically defined in terms of rewards or transitions, whereas online RL algorithms operate on Bellman regression targets. As a result, naively reusing source Bellman updates introduces systematic bias and invalidates regret guarantees.
  We identify one-step Bellman alignment as the correct abstraction for transfer in online RL and propose re-weighted targeting (RWT), an operator-level correction that retargets continuation values and compensates for transition mismatch via a change of measure. RWT reduces task mismatch to a fixed one-step correction and enables statistically sound reuse of source data.
  This alignment yields a two-stage RWT $Q$-learning framework that separates variance reduction from bias correction. Under RKHS function approximation, we establish regret bounds that scale with the complexity of the task shift rather than the target MDP. Empirical results in both tabular and neural network settings demonstrate consistent improvements over single-task learning and naïve pooling, highlighting Bellman alignment as a model-agnostic transfer principle for online RL.]]></description>

Although diffusion-based zero-shot image restoration and enhancement methods have achieved great success, applying them to video restoration or enhancement will lead to severe temporal flickering. In this paper, we propose the first framework that utilizes the rapidly-developed video diffusion model to assist the image-based method in maintaining more temporal consistency for zero-shot video restoration and enhancement. We propose homologous latents fusion, heterogenous latents fusion, and a COT-based fusion ratio strategy to utilize both homologous and heterogenous text-to-video diffusion models to complement the image method. Moreover, we propose temporal-strengthening post-processing to utilize the image-to-video diffusion model to further improve temporal consistency. Our method is training-free and can be applied to any diffusion-based image restoration and enhancement methods. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.]]></description>

In the future of work discourse, AI is touted as the ultimate productivity amplifier. Yet, beneath the efficiency gains lie subtle erosions of human expertise and agency. This paper shifts focus from the future of work to the future of workers by navigating the AI-as-Amplifier Paradox: AI's dual role as enhancer and eroder, simultaneously strengthening performance while eroding underlying expertise. We present a year-long study on the longitudinal use of AI in a high-stakes workplace among cancer specialists. Initial operational gains hid ``intuition rust'': the gradual dulling of expert judgment. These asymptomatic effects evolved into chronic harms, such as skill atrophy and identity commoditization. Building on these findings, we offer a framework for dignified Human-AI interaction co-constructed with professional knowledge workers facing AI-induced skill erosion without traditional labor protections. The framework operationalizes sociotechnical immunity through dual-purpose mechanisms that serve institutional quality goals while building worker power to detect, contain, and recover from skill erosion, and preserve human identity. Evaluated across healthcare and software engineering, our work takes a foundational step toward dignified human-AI interaction futures by balancing productivity with the preservation of human expertise.]]></description>

The inference overhead induced by redundant reasoning undermines the interactive experience and severely bottlenecks the deployment of Large Reasoning Models. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based solutions tackle this problem by coupling a length penalty with outcome-based rewards. This simplistic reward weighting struggles to reconcile brevity with accuracy, as enforcing brevity may compromise critical reasoning logic. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing a multi-agent RL framework that selectively penalizes redundant chunks, while preserving essential reasoning logic. Our framework, Self-Compression via MARL (SCMA), instantiates redundancy detection and evaluation through two specialized agents: \textbf{a Segmentation Agent} for decomposing the reasoning process into logical chunks, and \textbf{a Scoring Agent} for quantifying the significance of each chunk. The Segmentation and Scoring agents collaboratively define an importance-weighted length penalty during training, incentivizing \textbf{a Reasoning Agent} to prioritize essential logic without introducing inference overhead during deployment. Empirical evaluations across model scales demonstrate that SCMA reduces response length by 11.1\% to 39.0\% while boosting accuracy by 4.33\% to 10.02\%. Furthermore, ablation studies and qualitative analysis validate that the synergistic optimization within the MARL framework fosters emergent behaviors, yielding more powerful LRMs compared to vanilla RL paradigms.]]></description>

We show that computing even very coarse approximations of critical points is intractable for simple classes of nonconvex functions. More concretely, we prove that if there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that takes as input a polynomial in $n$ variables of constant degree (as low as three) and outputs a point whose gradient has Euclidean norm at most $2^n$ whenever the polynomial has a critical point, then P=NP. The algorithm is permitted to return an arbitrary point when no critical point exists. We also prove hardness results for approximate computation of critical points under additional structural assumptions, including settings in which existence and uniqueness of a critical point are guaranteed, the function is lower bounded, and approximation is measured in terms of distance to a critical point. Overall, our results stand in contrast to the commonly-held belief that, in nonconvex optimization, approximate computation of critical points is a tractable task.]]></description>

The evolution of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shifted from static retrieval pipelines to dynamic, agentic workflows where a central planner orchestrates multi-turn reasoning. However, existing paradigms face a critical dichotomy: they either optimize modules jointly within rigid, fixed-graph architectures, or empower dynamic planning while treating executors as frozen, black-box tools. We identify that this \textit{decoupled optimization} creates a ``strategic-operational mismatch,'' where sophisticated planning strategies fail to materialize due to unadapted local executors, often leading to negative performance gains despite increased system complexity. In this paper, we propose \textbf{JADE} (\textbf{J}oint \textbf{A}gentic \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{E}xecution), a unified framework for the joint optimization of planning and execution within dynamic, multi-turn workflows. By modeling the system as a cooperative multi-agent team unified under a single shared backbone, JADE enables end-to-end learning driven by outcome-based rewards. This approach facilitates \textit{co-adaptation}: the planner learns to operate within the capability boundaries of the executors, while the executors evolve to align with high-level strategic intent. Empirical results demonstrate that JADE transforms disjoint modules into a synergistic system, yielding remarkable performance improvements via joint optimization and enabling a flexible balance between efficiency and effectiveness through dynamic workflow orchestration.]]></description>

Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated outstanding capabilities in various visual perception tasks, which has in turn made the evaluation of LMMs significant. However, the capability of video aesthetic quality assessment, which is a fundamental ability for human, remains underexplored for LMMs. To address this, we introduce VideoAesBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LMMs' understanding of video aesthetic quality. VideoAesBench has several significant characteristics: (1) Diverse content including 1,804 videos from multiple video sources including user-generated (UGC), AI-generated (AIGC), compressed, robotic-generated (RGC), and game videos. (2) Multiple question formats containing traditional single-choice questions, multi-choice questions, True or False questions, and a novel open-ended questions for video aesthetics description. (3) Holistic video aesthetics dimensions including visual form related questions from 5 aspects, visual style related questions from 4 aspects, and visual affectiveness questions from 3 aspects. Based on VideoAesBench, we benchmark 23 open-source and commercial large multimodal models. Our findings show that current LMMs only contain basic video aesthetics perception ability, their performance remains incomplete and imprecise. We hope our VideoAesBench can be served as a strong testbed and offer insights for explainable video aesthetics assessment.]]></description>

Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a promising paradigm for optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in complex reasoning tasks. However, traditional outcome-based RL approaches often suffer from reward sparsity and inefficient credit assignment, as coarse-grained scalar rewards fail to identify specific erroneous steps within long-horizon trajectories. This ambiguity frequently leads to "process hallucinations", where models reach correct answers through flawed logic or redundant retrieval steps. Although recent process-aware approaches attempt to mitigate this via static preference learning or heuristic reward shaping, they often lack the on-policy exploration capabilities required to decouple step-level credit from global outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose ProRAG, a process-supervised reinforcement learning framework designed to integrate learned step-level supervision into the online optimization loop. Our framework consists of four stages: (1) Supervised Policy Warmup to initialize the model with a structured reasoning format; (2) construction of an MCTS-based Process Reward Model (PRM) to quantify intermediate reasoning quality; (3) PRM-Guided Reasoning Refinement to align the policy with fine-grained process preferences; and (4) Process-Supervised Reinforcement Learning with a dual-granularity advantage mechanism. By aggregating step-level process rewards with global outcome signals, ProRAG provides precise feedback for every action. Extensive experiments on five multi-hop reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ProRAG achieves superior overall performance compared to strong outcome-based and process-aware RL baselines, particularly on complex long-horizon tasks, validating the effectiveness of fine-grained process supervision. The code and model are available at https://github.com/lilinwz/ProRAG.]]></description>

Current LLM post-training methods optimize complete reasoning trajectories through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by outcome-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, a closer examination reveals a fundamental gap: this approach does not align with how humans actually solve problems. Human cognition naturally decomposes problem-solving into two distinct stages: first acquiring abstract strategies (i.e., meta-knowledge) that generalize across problems, then adapting them to specific instances. In contrast, by treating complete trajectories as basic units, current methods are inherently problem-centric, entangling abstract strategies with problem-specific execution. To address this misalignment, we propose a cognitively-inspired framework that explicitly mirrors the two-stage human cognitive process. Specifically, Chain-of-Meta-Thought (CoMT) focuses supervised learning on abstract reasoning patterns without specific executions, enabling acquisition of generalizable strategies. Confidence-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) then optimizes task adaptation via confidence-aware rewards on intermediate steps, preventing overconfident errors from cascading and improving execution reliability. Experiments across four models and eight benchmarks show 2.19\% and 4.63\% improvements in-distribution and out-of-distribution respectively over standard methods, while reducing training time by 65-70% and token consumption by 50%, demonstrating that aligning post-training with human cognitive principles yields not only superior generalization but also enhanced training efficiency.]]></description>

As a foundational task in human-centric cross-modal intelligence, motion-language retrieval aims to bridge the semantic gap between natural language and human motion, enabling intuitive motion analysis, yet existing approaches predominantly focus on aligning entire motion sequences with global textual representations. This global-centric paradigm overlooks fine-grained interactions between local motion segments and individual body joints and text tokens, inevitably leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from the pyramidal process of human motion perception (from joint dynamics to segment coherence, and finally to holistic comprehension) and propose a novel Pyramidal Shapley-Taylor (PST) learning framework for fine-grained motion-language retrieval. Specifically, the framework decomposes human motion into temporal segments and spatial body joints, and learns cross-modal correspondences through progressive joint-wise and segment-wise alignment in a pyramidal fashion, effectively capturing both local semantic details and hierarchical structural relationships. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving precise alignment between motion segments and body joints and their corresponding text tokens. The code of this work will be released upon acceptance.]]></description>

Machine learning models are routinely deployed on a wide range of computing hardware. Although such hardware is typically expected to produce identical results, differences in its design can lead to small numerical variations during inference. In this work, we show that these variations can be exploited to create backdoors in machine learning models. The core idea is to shape the model's decision function such that it yields different predictions for the same input when executed on different hardware. This effect is achieved by locally moving the decision boundary close to a target input and then refining numerical deviations to flip the prediction on selected hardware. We empirically demonstrate that these hardware-triggered backdoors can be created reliably across common GPU accelerators. Our findings reveal a novel attack vector affecting the use of third-party models, and we investigate different defenses to counter this threat.]]></description>

Despite their capabilities, large foundation models (LFMs) remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation. Current defenses predominantly rely on the "locality hypothesis", suppressing isolated neurons or features. However, harmful semantics act as distributed, cross-layer circuits, rendering such localized interventions brittle and detrimental to utility. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{TraceRouter}, a path-level framework that traces and disconnects the causal propagation circuits of illicit semantics. TraceRouter operates in three stages: (1) it pinpoints a sensitive onset layer by analyzing attention divergence; (2) it leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and differential activation analysis to disentangle and isolate malicious features; and (3) it maps these features to downstream causal pathways via feature influence scores (FIS) derived from zero-out interventions. By selectively suppressing these causal chains, TraceRouter physically severs the flow of harmful information while leaving orthogonal computation routes intact. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraceRouter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a superior trade-off between adversarial robustness and general utility. Our code will be publicly released. WARNING: This paper contains unsafe model responses.]]></description>

Global air quality forecasting grapples with extreme spatial heterogeneity and the poor generalization of existing transductive models to unseen regions. To tackle this, we propose OmniAir, a semantic topology learning framework tailored for global station-level prediction. By encoding invariant physical environmental attributes into generalizable station identities and dynamically constructing adaptive sparse topologies, our approach effectively captures long-range non-Euclidean correlations and physical diffusion patterns across unevenly distributed global networks. We further curate WorldAir, a massive dataset covering over 7,800 stations worldwide. Extensive experiments show that OmniAir achieves state-of-the-art performance against 18 baselines, maintaining high efficiency and scalability with speeds nearly 10 times faster than existing models, while effectively bridging the monitoring gap in data-sparse regions.]]></description>

The rise of model hubs has made it easier to access reusable model components, making model merging a practical tool for combining capabilities. Yet, this modularity also creates a \emph{governance gap}: downstream users can recompose released weights into unauthorized mixtures that bypass safety alignment or licensing terms. Because existing defenses are largely post-hoc and architecture-specific, they provide inconsistent protection across diverse architectures and release formats in practice. To close this gap, we propose \textsc{Trap}$^{2}$, an architecture-agnostic protection framework that encodes protection into the update during fine-tuning, regardless of whether they are released as adapters or full models. Instead of relying on architecture-dependent approaches, \textsc{Trap}$^{2}$ uses weight re-scaling as a simple proxy for the merging process. It keeps released weights effective in standalone use, but degrades them under re-scaling that often arises in merging, undermining unauthorized merging.]]></description>

Massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) downlink precoding offers high spectral efficiency but remains challenging to deploy in practice because near-optimal algorithms such as the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) are computationally expensive, and sensitive to SNR and channel-estimation quality, while existing deep learning (DL)-based solutions often lack robustness and require retraining for each deployment site. This paper proposes a plug-and-play precoder (PaPP), a DL framework with a backbone that can be trained for either fully digital (FDP) or hybrid beamforming (HBF) precoding and reused across sites, transmit-power levels, and with varying amounts of channel estimation error, avoiding the need to train a new model from scratch at each deployment. PaPP combines a high-capacity teacher and a compact student with a self-supervised loss that balances teacher imitation and normalized sum-rate, trained using meta-learning domain-generalization and transmit-power-aware input normalization. Numerical results on ray-tracing data from three unseen sites show that the PaPP FDP and HBF models both outperform conventional and deep learning baselines, after fine-tuning with a small set of local unlabeled samples. Across both architectures, PaPP achieves more than 21$\times$ reduction in modeled computation energy and maintains good performance under channel-estimation errors, making it a practical solution for energy-efficient mMIMO precoding.]]></description>

Video generation is pivotal to digital media creation, and recent advances in autoregressive video generation have markedly enhanced the efficiency of real-time video synthesis. However, existing approaches generally rely on heuristic KV Cache policies, which ignore differences in token importance in long-term video generation. This leads to the loss of critical spatiotemporal information and the accumulation of redundant, invalid cache, thereby degrading video generation quality and efficiency. To address this limitation, we first observe that token contributions to video generation are highly time-heterogeneous and accordingly propose a novel Past- and Future-Informed KV Cache Policy (PaFu-KV). Specifically, PaFu-KV introduces a lightweight Salience Estimation Head distilled from a bidirectional teacher to estimate salience scores, allowing the KV cache to retain informative tokens while discarding less relevant ones. This policy yields a better quality-efficiency trade-off by shrinking KV cache capacity and reducing memory footprint at inference time. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method preserves high-fidelity video generation quality while enables accelerated inference, thereby enabling more efficient long-horizon video generation. Our code will be released upon paper acceptance.]]></description>

Modern large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Claude, and Gemini have transformed the way we learn, work, and communicate. Yet, their ability to produce highly human-like text raises serious concerns about misinformation and academic integrity, making it an urgent need for reliable algorithms to detect LLM-generated content. In this paper, we start by presenting a geometric approach to demystify rewrite-based detection algorithms, revealing their underlying rationale and demonstrating their generalization ability. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel rewrite-based detection algorithm that adaptively learns the distance between the original and rewritten text. Theoretically, we demonstrate that employing an adaptively learned distance function is more effective for detection than using a fixed distance. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments with over 100 settings, and find that our approach demonstrates superior performance over baseline algorithms in the majority of scenarios. In particular, it achieves relative improvements from 57.8\% to 80.6\% over the strongest baseline across different target LLMs (e.g., GPT, Claude, and Gemini).]]></description>

Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit strong reasoning abilities, often attributed to their capacity to generate chain-of-thought-style intermediate reasoning. Recent work suggests that exposure to code can further enhance these skills, but existing studies largely treat code as a generic training signal, leaving open the question of which properties of code actually contribute to improved reasoning. To address this gap, we study the structural complexity of code, which captures control flow and compositional structure that may shape how models internalise multi-step reasoning during fine-tuning. We examine two complementary settings: solution-driven complexity, where complexity varies across multiple solutions to the same problem, and problem-driven complexity, where complexity reflects variation in the underlying tasks. Using cyclomatic complexity and logical lines of code to construct controlled fine-tuning datasets, we evaluate a range of open-weight LLMs on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that although code can improve reasoning, structural properties strongly determine its usefulness. In 83% of experiments, restricting fine-tuning data to a specific structural complexity range outperforms training on structurally diverse code, pointing to a data-centric path for improving reasoning beyond scaling.]]></description>

Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for controllable generation in diffusion and flow-based models. Despite its empirical success, CFG relies on a heuristic linear extrapolation that is often sensitive to the guidance scale. In this work, we provide a principled interpretation of CFG through the lens of optimization. We demonstrate that the velocity field in flow matching corresponds to the gradient of a sequence of smoothed distance functions, which guides latent variables toward the scaled target image set. This perspective reveals that the standard CFG formulation is an approximation of this gradient, where the prediction gap, the discrepancy between conditional and unconditional outputs, governs guidance sensitivity. Leveraging this insight, we reformulate the CFG sampling as a homotopy optimization with a manifold constraint. This formulation necessitates a manifold projection step, which we implement via an incremental gradient descent scheme during sampling. To improve computational efficiency and stability, we further enhance this iterative process with Anderson Acceleration without requiring additional model evaluations. Our proposed methods are training-free and consistently refine generation fidelity, prompt alignment, and robustness to the guidance scale. We validate their effectiveness across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements on large-scale models such as DiT-XL-2-256, Flux, and Stable Diffusion 3.5.]]></description>

We design a variational state estimation (VSE) method that provides a closed-form Gaussian posterior of an underlying complex dynamical process from (noisy) nonlinear measurements. The complex process is model-free. That is, we do not have a suitable physics-based model characterizing the temporal evolution of the process state. The closed-form Gaussian posterior is provided by a recurrent neural network (RNN). The use of RNN is computationally simple in the inference phase. For learning the RNN, an additional RNN is used in the learning phase. Both RNNs help each other learn better based on variational inference principles. The VSE is demonstrated for a tracking application - state estimation of a stochastic Lorenz system (a benchmark process) using a 2-D camera measurement model. The VSE is shown to be competitive against a particle filter that knows the Lorenz system model and a recently proposed data-driven state estimation method that does not know the Lorenz system model.]]></description>

Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have proven effective at solving Multi-Objective Optimisation Problems (MOOPs). However, their performance can be significantly hindered when applied to computationally intensive industrial problems. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptive surrogate modelling approach designed to accelerate the early-stage convergence speed of state-of-the-art MOEAs. This is important because it ensures that a solver can identify optimal or near-optimal solutions with relatively few fitness function evaluations, thereby saving both time and computational resources. Our method employs a two-loop architecture. The outer loop runs a (baseline) host MOEA which carries out true fitness evaluations. The inner loop contains an Adaptive Accelerator that leverages data-driven machine learning (ML) surrogate models to approximate fitness functions. Integrated with NSGA-II and MOEA/D, our approach was tested on 31 widely known benchmark problems and a real-world North Sea fish abundance modelling case study. The results demonstrate that by incorporating Gaussian Process Regression, one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks, and Random Forest Regression, our proposed approach significantly accelerates the convergence speed of MOEAs in the early phases of optimisation.]]></description>

Decision-focused learning integrates predictive modeling and combinatorial optimization by training models to directly improve decision quality rather than prediction accuracy alone. Differentiating through combinatorial optimization problems represents a central challenge, and recent approaches tackle this difficulty by introducing perturbation-based approximations. In this work, we focus on estimating the objective function coefficients of a combinatorial optimization problem. Our study demonstrates that fluctuations in perturbation intensity occurring during the learning phase can lead to ineffective training, by establishing a theoretical link to the notion of solution stability in combinatorial optimization. We propose addressing this issue by introducing a regularization of the estimated cost vectors which improves the robustness and reliability of the learning process, as demonstrated by extensive numerical experiments.]]></description>

Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a widely used class of machine learning models for graph-structured data, based on local aggregation over neighbors. GNNs have close connections to logic. In particular, their expressive power is linked to that of modal logics and bounded-variable logics with counting. In many practical scenarios, graphs processed by GNNs have node features that act as unique identifiers. In this work, we study how such identifiers affect the expressive power of GNNs. We initiate a study of the key-invariant expressive power of GNNs, inspired by the notion of order-invariant definability in finite model theory: which node queries that depend only on the underlying graph structure can GNNs express on graphs with unique node identifiers? We provide answers for various classes of GNNs with local max- or sum-aggregation.]]></description>

Benchmark Design in Black-Box Optimization (BBO) is a fundamental yet open-ended topic. Early BBO benchmarks are predominantly human-crafted, introducing expert bias and constraining diversity. Automating this design process can relieve the human-in-the-loop burden while enhancing diversity and objectivity. We propose Evolution of Benchmark (EoB), an automated BBO benchmark designer empowered by the large language model (LLM) and its program evolution capability. Specifically, we formulate benchmark design as a bi-objective optimization problem towards maximizing (i) landscape diversity and (ii) algorithm-differentiation ability across a portfolio of BBO solvers. Under this paradigm, EoB iteratively prompts LLM to evolve a population of benchmark programs and employs a reflection-based scheme to co-evolve the landscape and its corresponding program. Comprehensive experiments validate our EoB is a competitive candidate in multi-dimensional usages: 1) Benchmarking BBO algorithms; 2) Training and testing learning-assisted BBO algorithms; 3) Extending proxy for expensive real-world problems.]]></description>

Learning systems often expand their ambient features or latent representations over time, embedding earlier representations into larger spaces with limited new latent structure. We study transfer learning for structured matrix estimation under simultaneous growth of the ambient dimension and the intrinsic representation, where a well-estimated source task is embedded as a subspace of a higher-dimensional target task.
  We propose a general transfer framework in which the target parameter decomposes into an embedded source component, low-dimensional low-rank innovations, and sparse edits, and develop an anchored alternating projection estimator that preserves transferred subspaces while estimating only low-dimensional innovations and sparse modifications. We establish deterministic error bounds that separate target noise, representation growth, and source estimation error, yielding strictly improved rates when rank and sparsity increments are small.
  We demonstrate the generality of the framework by applying it to two canonical problems. For Markov transition matrix estimation from a single trajectory, we derive end-to-end theoretical guarantees under dependent noise. For structured covariance estimation under enlarged dimensions, we provide complementary theoretical analysis in the appendix and empirically validate consistent transfer gains.]]></description>

Understanding the stability and long-time behavior of generative models is a fundamental problem in modern machine learning. This paper provides quantitative bounds on the sampling error of score-based generative models by leveraging stability and forgetting properties of the Markov chain associated with the reverse-time dynamics. Under weak assumptions, we provide the two structural properties to ensure the propagation of initialization and discretization errors of the backward process: a Lyapunov drift condition and a Doeblin-type minorization condition. A practical consequence is quantitative stability of the sampling procedure, as the reverse diffusion dynamics induces a contraction mechanism along the sampling trajectory. Our results clarify the role of stochastic dynamics in score-based models and provide a principled framework for analyzing propagation of errors in such approaches.]]></description>

Real-world multivariate time series can exhibit intricate multi-scale structures, including global trends, local periodicities, and non-stationary regimes, which makes long-horizon forecasting challenging. Although sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches improve scalability and specialization, they typically rely on homogeneous MLP experts that poorly capture the diverse temporal dynamics of time series data. We address these limitations with MoHETS, an encoder-only Transformer that integrates sparse Mixture-of-Heterogeneous-Experts (MoHE) layers. MoHE routes temporal patches to a small subset of expert networks, combining a shared depthwise-convolution expert for sequence-level continuity with routed Fourier-based experts for patch-level periodic structures. MoHETS further improves robustness to non-stationary dynamics by incorporating exogenous information via cross-attention over covariate patch embeddings. Finally, we replace parameter-heavy linear projection heads with a lightweight convolutional patch decoder, improving parameter efficiency, reducing training instability, and allowing a single model to generalize across arbitrary forecast horizons. We validate across seven multivariate benchmarks and multiple horizons, with MoHETS consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance, reducing the average MSE by $12\%$ compared to strong recent baselines, demonstrating effective heterogeneous specialization for long-term forecasting.]]></description>

Large language models (LLMs) exhibit social biases that reinforce harmful stereotypes, limiting their safe deployment. Most existing debiasing methods adopt a suppressive paradigm by modifying parameters, prompts, or neurons associated with biased behavior; however, such approaches are often brittle, weakly generalizable, data-inefficient, and prone to degrading general capability. We propose \textbf{KnowBias}, a lightweight and conceptually distinct framework that mitigates bias by strengthening, rather than suppressing, neurons encoding bias-knowledge. KnowBias identifies neurons encoding bias knowledge using a small set of bias-knowledge questions via attribution-based analysis, and selectively enhances them at inference time. This design enables strong debiasing while preserving general capabilities, generalizes across bias types and demographics, and is highly data efficient, requiring only a handful of simple yes/no questions and no retraining. Experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art debiasing performance with minimal utility degradation. Data and code are available at https://github.com/JP-25/KnowBias.]]></description>

The reconstruction and inference of stochastic dynamical systems from data is a fundamental task in inverse problems and statistical learning. While surrogate modeling advances computational methods to approximate these dynamics, standard approaches typically require high-fidelity training data. In many practical settings, the data are indirectly observed through noisy and nonlinear measurement. The challenge lies not only in approximating the coefficients of the SDEs, but in simultaneously inferring the posterior updates given the observations. In this work, we present a neural path estimation approach to solve stochastic dynamical systems based on variational inference. We first derive a stochastic control problem that solve filtering posterior path measure corresponding to a pathwise Zakai equation. We then construct a generative model that maps the prior path measure to posterior measure through the controlled diffusion and the associated Randon-Nykodym derivative. Through an amortization of sample paths of the observation process, the control is learned by an embedding of the noisy observation paths. Thus, we learn the unknown prior SDE and the control can recover the conditional path measure given the observation sample paths and we learn an associated SDE which induces the same path measure. In the end, we perform experiments on nonlinear dynamical systems, demonstrating the model's ability to learn multimodal, chaotic, or high dimensional systems.]]></description>

We present a diffusion-based framework for document-centric background generation that achieves foreground preservation and multi-page stylistic consistency through latent-space design rather than explicit constraints. Instead of suppressing diffusion updates or applying masking heuristics, our approach reinterprets diffusion as the evolution of stochastic trajectories through a structured latent space. By shaping the initial noise and its geometric alignment, background generation naturally avoids designated foreground regions, allowing readable content to remain intact without auxiliary mechanisms. To address the long-standing issue of stylistic drift across pages, we decouple style control from text conditioning and introduce cached style directions as persistent vectors in latent space. Once selected, these directions constrain diffusion trajectories to a shared stylistic subspace, ensuring consistent appearance across pages and editing iterations. This formulation eliminates the need for repeated prompt-based style specification and provides a more stable foundation for multi-page generation. Our framework admits a geometric and physical interpretation, where diffusion paths evolve on a latent manifold shaped by preferred directions, and foreground regions are rarely traversed as a consequence of trajectory initialization rather than explicit exclusion. The proposed method is training-free, compatible with existing diffusion backbones, and produces visually coherent, foreground-preserving results across complex documents. By reframing diffusion as trajectory design in latent space, we offer a principled approach to consistent and structured generative modeling.]]></description>

Ultrasound (US) interpretation is hampered by multiplicative speckle, acquisition blur from the point-spread function (PSF), and scanner- and operator-dependent artifacts. Supervised enhancement methods assume access to clean targets or known degradations; conditions rarely met in practice. We present a blind, self-supervised enhancement framework that jointly deconvolves and denoises B-mode images using a Swin Convolutional U-Net trained with a \emph{physics-guided} degradation model. From each training frame, we extract rotated/cropped patches and synthesize inputs by (i) convolving with a Gaussian PSF surrogate and (ii) injecting noise via either spatial additive Gaussian noise or complex Fourier-domain perturbations that emulate phase/magnitude distortions. For US scans, clean-like targets are obtained via non-local low-rank (NLLR) denoising, removing the need for ground truth; for natural images, the originals serve as targets. Trained and validated on UDIAT~B, JNU-IFM, and XPIE Set-P, and evaluated additionally on a 700-image PSFHS test set, the method achieves the highest PSNR/SSIM across Gaussian and speckle noise levels, with margins that widen under stronger corruption. Relative to MSANN, Restormer, and DnCNN, it typically preserves an extra $\sim$1--4\,dB PSNR and 0.05--0.15 SSIM in heavy Gaussian noise, and $\sim$2--5\,dB PSNR and 0.05--0.20 SSIM under severe speckle. Controlled PSF studies show reduced FWHM and higher peak gradients, evidence of resolution recovery without edge erosion. Used as a plug-and-play preprocessor, it consistently boosts Dice for fetal head and pubic symphysis segmentation. Overall, the approach offers a practical, assumption-light path to robust US enhancement that generalizes across datasets, scanners, and degradation types.]]></description>

Multi-vector representations generated by late interaction models, such as ColBERT, enable superior retrieval quality compared to single-vector representations in information retrieval applications. In multi-vector retrieval systems, both queries and documents are encoded using one embedding for each token, and similarity between queries and documents is measured by the MaxSim similarity measure. However, the improved recall of multi-vector retrieval comes at the expense of significantly increased latency. This necessitates designing efficient approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms for multi-vector search. In this work, we introduce LEMUR, a simple-yet-efficient framework for multi-vector similarity search. LEMUR consists of two consecutive problem reductions: We first formulate multi-vector similarity search as a supervised learning problem that can be solved using a one-hidden-layer neural network. Second, we reduce inference under this model to single-vector similarity search in its latent space, which enables the use of existing single-vector ANNS methods for speeding up retrieval. In addition to performance evaluation on ColBERTv2 embeddings, we evaluate LEMUR on embeddings generated by modern multi-vector text models and multi-vector visual document retrieval models. LEMUR is an order of magnitude faster than earlier multi-vector similarity search methods.]]></description>

Foundation models, despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, remain vulnerable to spurious correlations and 'Clever Hans' strategies. Existing mitigation methods often rely on unavailable group labels or computationally expensive gradient-based adversarial optimization. To address these limitations, we propose Visual Disentangled Diffusion Autoencoders (DiDAE), a novel framework integrating frozen foundation models with disentangled dictionary learning for efficient, gradient-free counterfactual generation directly for the foundation model. DiDAE first edits foundation model embeddings in interpretable disentangled directions of the disentangled dictionary and then decodes them via a diffusion autoencoder. This allows the generation of multiple diverse, disentangled counterfactuals for each factual, much faster than existing baselines, which generate single entangled counterfactuals. When paired with Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation, DiDAE-CFKD achieves state-of-the-art performance in mitigating shortcut learning, improving downstream performance on unbalanced datasets.]]></description>

Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) is an emerging avenue within Optimization community, where algorithm design policy could be meta-learned by reinforcement learning to enhance optimization performance. So far, the reward functions in existing MetaBBO works are designed by human experts, introducing certain design bias and risks of reward hacking. In this paper, we use Large Language Model~(LLM) as an automated reward discovery tool for MetaBBO. Specifically, we consider both effectiveness and efficiency sides. On effectiveness side, we borrow the idea of evolution of heuristics, introducing tailored evolution paradigm in the iterative LLM-based program search process, which ensures continuous improvement. On efficiency side, we additionally introduce multi-task evolution architecture to support parallel reward discovery for diverse MetaBBO approaches. Such parallel process also benefits from knowledge sharing across tasks to accelerate convergence. Empirical results demonstrate that the reward functions discovered by our approach could be helpful for boosting existing MetaBBO works, underscoring the importance of reward design in MetaBBO.

Meta reinforcement learning (RL) allows agents to leverage experience across a distribution of tasks on which the agent can train at will, enabling faster learning of optimal policies on new test tasks. Despite its success in improving sample complexity on test tasks, many real-world applications, such as robotics and healthcare, impose safety constraints during testing. Constrained meta RL provides a promising framework for integrating safety into meta RL. An open question in constrained meta RL is how to ensure the safety of the policy on the real-world test task, while reducing the sample complexity and thus, enabling faster learning of optimal policies. To address this gap, we propose an algorithm that refines policies learned during training, with provable safety and sample complexity guarantees for learning a near optimal policy on the test tasks. We further derive a matching lower bound, showing that this sample complexity is tight.]]></description>

Efficient management of spare parts inventory is crucial in the automotive aftermarket, where demand is highly intermittent and uncertainty drives substantial cost and service risks. Forecasting is therefore central, but the quality of a forecasting model should be judged not by statistical accuracy (e.g., MAE, RMSE, IAE) but rather by its impact on key operational performance indicators (KPIs), such as total cost and service level. Yet most existing work evaluates models exclusively using accuracy metrics, and the relationship between these metrics and operational KPIs remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we propose a decision-centric simulation software framework that enables systematic evaluation of forecasting model in realistic inventory management setting. The framework comprises: (i) a synthetic demand generator tailored to spare-parts demand characteristics, (ii) a flexible forecasting module that can host arbitrary predictive models, and (iii) an inventory control simulator that consumes the forecasts and computes operational KPIs. This closed-loop setup enables researchers to evaluate models not only in terms of statistical error but also in terms of their downstream implications for inventory decisions. Using a wide range of simulation scenarios, we show that improvements in conventional accuracy metrics do not necessarily translate into better operational performance, and that models with similar statistical error profiles can induce markedly different cost-service trade-offs. We analyze these discrepancies to characterize how specific aspects of forecast performance affect inventory outcomes and derive guidance for model selection. Overall, the framework operationalizes the link between demand forecasting and inventory management, shifting evaluation from purely predictive accuracy toward operational relevance in the automotive aftermarket and related domains.]]></description>

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot reasoning capabilities, their deployment as embodied agents still faces fundamental challenges in long-horizon planning. Unlike open-ended text generation, embodied agents must decompose high-level intent into actionable sub-goals while strictly adhering to the logic of a dynamic, observed environment. Standard LLM planners frequently fail to maintain strategy coherence over extended horizons due to context window limitation or hallucinate transitions that violate constraints. We propose GiG, a novel planning framework that structures embodied agents' memory using a Graph-in-Graph architecture. Our approach employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to encode environmental states into embeddings, organizing these embeddings into action-connected execution trace graphs within an experience memory bank. By clustering these graph embeddings, the framework enables retrieval of structure-aware priors, allowing agents to ground current decisions in relevant past structural patterns. Furthermore, we introduce a novel bounded lookahead module that leverages symbolic transition logic to enhance the agents' planning capabilities through the grounded action projection. We evaluate our framework on three embodied planning benchmarks-Robotouille Synchronous, Robotouille Asynchronous, and ALFWorld. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving Pass@1 performance gains of up to 22% on Robotouille Synchronous, 37% on Asynchronous, and 15% on ALFWorld with comparable or lower computational cost.]]></description>

Test-time compute has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, this strategy has in turn increased how much users pay cloud-based providers offering LLM-as-a-service, since providers charge users for the amount of test-time compute they use to generate an output. In our work, we show that the market of LLM-as-a-service is socially inefficient: providers have a financial incentive to increase the amount of test-time compute, even if this increase contributes little to the quality of the outputs. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a reverse second-price auction mechanism where providers bid their offered price and (expected) quality for the opportunity to serve a user, and users pay proportionally to the marginal value generated by the winning provider relative to the second-highest bidder. To illustrate and complement our theoretical results, we conduct experiments with multiple instruct models from the $\texttt{Llama}$ and $\texttt{Qwen}$ families, as well as reasoning models distilled from $\texttt{DeepSeek-R1}$, on math and science benchmark datasets.]]></description>

In recent years, trustworthiness has garnered increasing attention and exploration in the field of intelligent education, due to the inherent sensitivity of educational scenarios, such as involving minors and vulnerable groups, highly personalized learning data, and high-stakes educational outcomes. However, existing research either focuses on task-specific trustworthy methods without a holistic view of trustworthy intelligent education, or provides survey-level discussions that remain high-level and fragmented, lacking a clear and systematic categorization. To address these limitations, in this paper, we present a systematic and structured review of trustworthy intelligent education. Specifically, We first organize intelligent education into five representative task categories: learner ability assessment, learning resource recommendation, learning analytics, educational content understanding, and instructional assistance. Building on this task landscape, we review existing studies from five trustworthiness perspectives, including safety and privacy, robustness, fairness, explainability, and sustainability, and summarize and categorize the research methodologies and solution strategies therein. Finally, we summarize key challenges and discuss future research directions. This survey aims to provide a coherent reference framework and facilitate a clearer understanding of trustworthiness in intelligent education.]]></description>

We introduce a scalable method to approximate the kernel of the Linearized Laplace Approximation (LLA). For this, we use a surrogate deep neural network (DNN) that learns a compact feature representation whose inner product replicates the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). This avoids the need to compute large Jacobians. Training relies solely on efficient Jacobian-vector products, allowing to compute predictive uncertainty on large-scale pre-trained DNNs. Experimental results show similar or improved uncertainty estimation and calibration compared to existing LLA approximations. Notwithstanding, biasing the learned kernel significantly enhances out-of-distribution detection. This remarks the benefits of the proposed method for finding better kernels than the NTK in the context of LLA to compute prediction uncertainty given a pre-trained DNN.]]></description>

Machine learning models are widely regarded as a way forward to tackle multi-query challenges that arise once expensive black-box simulations such as computational fluid dynamics are investigated. However, ensuring the desired level of accuracy for a certain task at minimal computational cost, e.g. as few black-box samples as possible, remains a challenges. Active learning strategies are used for scalar quantities to overcome this challenges and different so-called infill criteria exists and are commonly employed in several scenarios. Even though needed in various field an extension of active learning strategies towards field predictions is still lacking or limited to very specific scenarios and/or model types. In this paper we propose an active learning strategy for machine learning models that are capable if predicting field which is agnostic to the model architecture itself. For doing so, we combine a well-established Gaussian process model for a scalar reference value and simultaneously aim at reducing the epistemic model error and the difference between scalar and field predictions. Different specific forms of the above-mentioned approach are introduced and compared to each other as well as only scalar-valued based infill. Results are presented for the NASA common research model for an uncertainty propagation task showcasing high level of accuracy at significantly smaller cost compared to an approach without active learning.]]></description>

We introduce the use of latent subspaces in the exponential parameter space of product manifolds of categorial distributions, as a tool for learning generative models of discrete data. The low-dimensional latent space encodes statistical dependencies and removes redundant degrees of freedom among the categorial variables. We equip the parameter domain with a Riemannian geometry such that the spaces and distances are related by isometries which enables consistent flow matching. In particular, geodesics become straight lines which makes model training by flow matching effective. Empirical results demonstrate that reduced latent dimensions suffice to represent data for generative modeling.]]></description>

The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a cost-effective, highly accessible and widely employed diagnostic tool. With the advent of Foundation Models (FMs), the field of AI-assisted ECG interpretation has begun to evolve, as they enable model reuse across different tasks by relying on embeddings. However, to responsibly employ FMs, it is crucial to rigorously assess to which extent the embeddings they produce are generalizable, particularly in error-sensitive domains such as healthcare. Although prior works have already addressed the problem of benchmarking ECG-expert FMs, they focus predominantly on the evaluation of downstream performance. To fill this gap, this study aims to find an in-depth, comprehensive benchmarking framework for FMs, with a specific focus on ECG-expert ones. To this aim, we introduce a benchmark methodology that complements performance-based evaluation with representation-level analysis, leveraging SHAP and UMAP techniques. Furthermore, we rely on the methodology for carrying out an extensive evaluation of several ECG-expert FMs pretrained via state-of-the-art techniques over different cross-continental datasets and data availability settings; this includes ones featuring data scarcity, a fairly common situation in real-world medical scenarios. Experimental results show that our benchmarking protocol provides a rich insight of ECG-expert FMs' embedded patterns, enabling a deeper understanding of their representational structure and generalizability.]]></description>

As large language models (LLMs) are applied to increasingly longer and more complex tasks, there is a growing need for realistic long-context benchmarks that require selective reading and integration of heterogeneous, multi-modal information sources. This need is especially acute for geospatial planning problems, such as those found in planning for large-scale military operations, which demand fast and accurate reasoning over maps, orders, intelligence reports, and other distributed data. To address this gap, we present MilSCORE (Military Scenario Contextual Reasoning), to our knowledge the first scenario-level dataset of expert-authored, multi-hop questions grounded in a complex, simulated military planning scenario used for training. MilSCORE is designed to evaluate high-stakes decision-making and planning, probing LLMs' ability to combine tactical and spatial reasoning across multiple sources and to reason over long-horizon, geospatially rich context. The benchmark includes a diverse set of question types across seven categories targeting both factual recall and multi-step reasoning about constraints, strategy, and spatial analysis. We provide an evaluation protocol and report baseline results for a range of contemporary vision-language models. Our findings highlight substantial headroom on MilSCORE, indicating that current systems struggle with realistic, scenario-level long-context planning, and positioning MilSCORE as a challenging testbed for future work.]]></description>

Determinism is indispensable for reproducibility in large language model (LLM) training, yet it often exacts a steep performance cost. In widely used attention implementations such as FlashAttention-3, the deterministic backward pass can incur up to a 37.9% throughput reduction relative to its non-deterministic counterpart, primarily because gradient accumulation operations must be serialized to guarantee numerical consistency. This performance loss stems from suboptimal scheduling of compute and gradient-reduction phases, leading to significant hardware underutilization.
  To address this challenge, we formulate the backward pass of deterministic attention as a scheduling problem on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and derive schedules that minimize the critical path length. Building on this formulation, we present DASH (Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-Throughput), which encapsulates two complementary scheduling strategies: (i) Descending Q-Tile Iteration, a reversed query-block traversal that shrinks pipeline stalls in causal attention, and (ii) Shift Scheduling, a theoretically optimal schedule within our DAG model that reduces pipeline stalls for both full and causal masks.
  Our empirical evaluations on NVIDIA H800 GPUs demonstrate that DASH narrows the performance gap of deterministic attention. The proposed strategies improve the throughput of the attention backward pass by up to 1.28$\times$ compared to the baseline, significantly advancing the efficiency of reproducible LLM training.

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are highly energy-efficient due to event-driven, sparse computation, but their training is challenged by spike non-differentiability and trade-offs among performance, efficiency, and biological plausibility. Crucially, mainstream SNNs ignore predictive coding, a core cortical mechanism where the brain predicts inputs and encodes errors for efficient perception. Inspired by this, we propose a self-prediction enhanced spiking neuron method that generates an internal prediction current from its input-output history to modulate membrane potential. This design offers dual advantages, it creates a continuous gradient path that alleviates vanishing gradients and boosts training stability and accuracy, while also aligning with biological principles, which resembles distal dendritic modulation and error-driven synaptic plasticity. Experiments show consistent performance gains across diverse architectures, neuron types, time steps, and tasks demonstrating broad applicability for enhancing SNNs.]]></description>

Rapid advancements in sixth-generation (6G) networks and large language models (LLMs) have paved the way for ubiquitous intelligence, wherein seamless connectivity and distributed artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized various aspects of our lives.However, realizing this vision faces significant challenges owing to the fragmented and heterogeneous computing resources across hierarchical networks, which are insufficient for individual LLM agents to perform complex reasoning tasks.To address this issue, we propose Collaborative Orchestration Role at Edge (CORE), an innovative framework that employs a collaborative learning system in which multiple LLMs, each assigned a distinct functional role, are distributed across mobile devices and tiered edge servers. The system integrates three optimization modules, encompassing real-time perception,dynamic role orchestration, and pipeline-parallel execution, to facilitate efficient and rapid collaboration among distributed agents. Furthermore, we introduce a novel role affinity scheduling algorithm for dynamically orchestrating LLM role assignments across the hierarchical edge infrastructure, intelligently matching computational demands with available dispersed resources.Finally, comprehensive case studies and performance evaluations across various 6G application scenarios demonstrated the efficacy of CORE, revealing significant enhancements in the system efficiency and task completion rates. Building on these promising outcomes, we further validated the practical applicability of CORE by deploying it on a real-world edge-computing platform,that exhibits robust performance in operational environments.]]></description>

Recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have driven significant progress in visual reasoning. However, open-source VLMs still lag behind proprietary systems, largely due to the lack of high-quality reasoning data. Existing datasets offer limited coverage of challenging domains such as STEM diagrams and visual puzzles, and lack consistent, long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations essential for eliciting strong reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMFineReason, a large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset comprising 1.8M samples and 5.1B solution tokens, featuring high-quality reasoning annotations distilled from Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking. The dataset is established via a systematic three-stage pipeline: (1) large-scale data collection and standardization, (2) CoT rationale generation, and (3) comprehensive selection based on reasoning quality and difficulty awareness. The resulting dataset spans STEM problems, visual puzzles, games, and complex diagrams, with each sample annotated with visually grounded reasoning traces. We fine-tune Qwen3-VL-Instruct on MMFineReason to develop MMFineReason-2B/4B/8B versions. Our models establish new state-of-the-art results for their size class. Notably, MMFineReason-4B succesfully surpasses Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking, and MMFineReason-8B even outperforms Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking while approaching Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency. Crucially, we uncover a "less is more" phenomenon via our difficulty-aware filtering strategy: a subset of just 7\% (123K samples) achieves performance comparable to the full dataset. Notably, we reveal a synergistic effect where reasoning-oriented data composition simultaneously boosts general capabilities.]]></description>

Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on open-ended tasks without ground-truth labels is increasingly done via the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm. A critical but under-modeled issue is that judge LLMs differ substantially in reliability; treating all judges equally can yield biased leaderboards and misleading uncertainty estimates. More data can make evaluation more confidently wrong under misspecified aggregation. We propose a judge-aware ranking framework that extends the Bradley-Terry-Luce model by introducing judge-specific discrimination parameters, jointly estimating latent model quality and judge reliability from pairwise comparisons without reference labels. We establish identifiability up to natural normalizations and prove consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator, enabling confidence intervals for score differences and rank comparisons. Across multiple public benchmarks and a newly collected dataset, our method improves agreement with human preferences, achieves higher data efficiency than unweighted baselines, and produces calibrated uncertainty quantification for LLM rankings.]]></description>

Evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) from human preference data is crucial for obtaining LLM leaderboards. However, many existing approaches either rely on restrictive parametric assumptions or lack valid uncertainty quantification when flexible machine learning methods are used. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric statistical framework, DMLEval, for comparing and ranking LLMs from preference data using debiased machine learning (DML). For this, we introduce generalized average ranking scores (GARS), which generalize commonly used ranking models, including the Bradley-Terry model or PageRank/ Rank centrality, with complex human responses such as ties. DMLEval comes with the following advantages: (i) It produces statistically efficient estimates of GARS ranking scores. (ii) It naturally allows the incorporation of black-box machine learning methods for estimation. (iii) It can be combined with pre-trained LLM evaluators (e.g., using LLM-as-a-judge). (iv) It suggests optimal policies for collecting preference data under budget constraints. We demonstrate these advantages both theoretically and empirically using both synthetic and real-world preference datasets. In summary, our framework provides practitioners with powerful, state-of-the-art methods for comparing or ranking LLMs.]]></description>

Understanding how media rhetoric shapes audience engagement is crucial in the attention economy. This study examines how moral emotional framing by mainstream news channels on YouTube influences user behavior across Korea and the United States. To capture the platform's multimodal nature, combining thumbnail images and video titles, we develop a multimodal moral emotion classifier by fine tuning a vision language model. The model is trained on human annotated multimodal datasets in both languages and applied to approximately 400,000 videos from major news outlets. We analyze engagement levels including views, likes, and comments, representing increasing degrees of commitment. The results show that other condemning rhetoric expressions of moral outrage that criticize others morally consistently increase all forms of engagement across cultures, with effects ranging from passive viewing to active commenting. These findings suggest that moral outrage is a particularly effective emotional strategy, attracting not only attention but also active participation. We discuss concerns about the potential misuse of other condemning rhetoric, as such practices may deepen polarization by reinforcing in group and out group divisions. To facilitate future research and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release our Korean and English multimodal moral emotion classifiers.]]></description>

We introduce a model-agnostic forward diffusion process for time-series forecasting that decomposes signals into spectral components, preserving structured temporal patterns such as seasonality more effectively than standard diffusion. Unlike prior work that modifies the network architecture or diffuses directly in the frequency domain, our proposed method alters only the diffusion process itself, making it compatible with existing diffusion backbones (e.g., DiffWave, TimeGrad, CSDI). By staging noise injection according to component energy, it maintains high signal-to-noise ratios for dominant frequencies throughout the diffusion trajectory, thereby improving the recoverability of long-term patterns. This strategy enables the model to maintain the signal structure for a longer period in the forward process, leading to improved forecast quality. Across standard forecasting benchmarks, we show that applying spectral decomposition strategies, such as the Fourier or Wavelet transform, consistently improves upon diffusion models using the baseline forward process, with negligible computational overhead.

Test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) enables large language models (LLMs) to self-improve on unlabeled inputs, but its effectiveness critically depends on how reward signals are estimated without ground-truth supervision. Most existing TTRL methods rely on majority voting (MV) over rollouts to produce deterministic rewards, implicitly assuming that the majority rollout provides a reliable learning signal. We show that this assumption is fragile: MV reduces the rollout distribution into a single outcome, discarding information about non-majority but correct actions candidates, and yields systematically biased reward estimates. To address this, we propose Distribution-AwareReward Estimation (DARE), which shifts reward estimation from a single majority outcome to the full empirical rollout distribution. DARE further augments this distribution-based reward with an exploration bonus and a distribution pruning mechanism for non-majority rollout exploration and reward denoise, yielding a more informative and robust reward estimation. Extensive experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks show that DARE improves optimization stability and final performance over recent baselines, achieving relative improvements of 25.3% on challenging AIME 2024 and 5.3% on AMC.]]></description>

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems combine dense retrievers and language models to ground LLM outputs in retrieved documents. However, the opacity of how these components interact creates challenges for deployment in high-stakes domains. We present RAG-E, an end-to-end explainability framework that quantifies retriever-generator alignment through mathematically grounded attribution methods. Our approach adapts Integrated Gradients for retriever analysis, introduces PMCSHAP, a Monte Carlo-stabilized Shapley Value approximation, for generator attribution, and introduces the Weighted Attribution-Relevance Gap (WARG) metric to measure how well a generator's document usage aligns with a retriever's ranking. Empirical analysis on TREC CAsT and FoodSafeSum reveals critical misalignments: for 47.4% to 66.7% of queries, generators ignore the retriever's top-ranked documents, while 48.1% to 65.9% rely on documents ranked as less relevant. These failure modes demonstrate that RAG output quality depends not solely on individual component performance but on their interplay, which can be audited via RAG-E.]]></description>

Endotracheal suctioning (ES) is an invasive yet essential clinical procedure that requires a high degree of skill to minimize patient risk - particularly in home care and educational settings, where consistent supervision may be limited. Despite its critical importance, automated recognition and feedback systems for ES training remain underexplored. To address this gap, this study proposes a unified, LLM-centered framework for video-based activity recognition benchmarked against conventional machine learning and deep learning approaches, and a pilot study on feedback generation. Within this framework, the Large Language Model (LLM) serves as the central reasoning module, performing both spatiotemporal activity recognition and explainable decision analysis from video data. Furthermore, the LLM is capable of verbalizing feedback in natural language, thereby translating complex technical insights into accessible, human-understandable guidance for trainees. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-based approach outperforms baseline models, achieving an improvement of approximately 15-20\% in both accuracy and F1 score. Beyond recognition, the framework incorporates a pilot student-support module built upon anomaly detection and explainable AI (XAI) principles, which provides automated, interpretable feedback highlighting correct actions and suggesting targeted improvements. Collectively, these contributions establish a scalable, interpretable, and data-driven foundation for advancing nursing education, enhancing training efficiency, and ultimately improving patient safety.]]></description>

This paper introduces BioAgent Bench, a benchmark dataset and an evaluation suite designed for measuring the performance and robustness of AI agents in common bioinformatics tasks. The benchmark contains curated end-to-end tasks (e.g., RNA-seq, variant calling, metagenomics) with prompts that specify concrete output artifacts to support automated assessment, including stress testing under controlled perturbations. We evaluate frontier closed-source and open-weight models across multiple agent harnesses, and use an LLM-based grader to score pipeline progress and outcome validity. We find that frontier agents can complete multi-step bioinformatics pipelines without elaborate custom scaffolding, often producing the requested final artifacts reliably. However, robustness tests reveal failure modes under controlled perturbations (corrupted inputs, decoy files, and prompt bloat), indicating that correct high-level pipeline construction does not guarantee reliable step-level reasoning. Finally, because bioinformatics workflows may involve sensitive patient data, proprietary references, or unpublished IP, closed-source models can be unsuitable under strict privacy constraints; in such settings, open-weight models may be preferable despite lower completion rates. We release the dataset and evaluation suite publicly.]]></description>

Large Language Models(LLMs) have revolutionized text generation and multimodal perception, but their capabilities in 3D content generation remain underexplored. Existing methods compromise by producing either low-resolution meshes or coarse structural proxies, failing to capture fine-grained geometry natively. In this paper, we propose CG-MLLM, a novel Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) capable of 3D captioning and high-resolution 3D generation in a single framework. Leveraging the Mixture-of-Transformer architecture, CG-MLLM decouples disparate modeling needs, where the Token-level Autoregressive (TokenAR) Transformer handles token-level content, and the Block-level Autoregressive (BlockAR) Transformer handles block-level content. By integrating a pre-trained vision-language backbone with a specialized 3D VAE latent space, CG-MLLM facilitates long-context interactions between standard tokens and spatial blocks within a single integrated architecture. Experimental results show that CG-MLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs in generating high-fidelity 3D objects, effectively bringing high-resolution 3D content creation into the mainstream LLM paradigm.]]></description>

Conversational agents struggle to handle long conversations due to context window limitations. Therefore, memory systems are developed to leverage essential historical information. Existing memory systems typically follow a pipeline of offline memory construction and update, and online retrieval. Despite the flexible online phase, the offline phase remains fixed and task-independent. In this phase, memory construction operates under a predefined workflow and fails to emphasize task relevant information. Meanwhile, memory updates are guided by generic metrics rather than task specific supervision. This leads to a misalignment between offline memory preparation and task requirements, which undermines downstream task performance. To this end, we propose an Adversarial Memory Adaptation mechanism (AMA) that aligns memory construction and update with task objectives by simulating task execution. Specifically, first, a challenger agent generates question answer pairs based on the original dialogues. The constructed memory is then used to answer these questions, simulating downstream inference. Subsequently, an evaluator agent assesses the responses and performs error analysis. Finally, an adapter agent analyzes the error cases and performs dual level updates on both the construction strategy and the content. Through this process, the memory system receives task aware supervision signals in advance during the offline phase, enhancing its adaptability to downstream tasks. AMA can be integrated into various existing memory systems, and extensive experiments on long dialogue benchmark LoCoMo demonstrate its effectiveness.]]></description>

Internet memes have become pervasive carriers of digital culture on social platforms. However, their heavy reliance on metaphors and sociocultural context also makes them subtle vehicles for harmful content, posing significant challenges for automated content moderation. Existing approaches primarily focus on intra-modal and inter-modal signal analysis, while the understanding of implicit toxicity often depends on background knowledge that is not explicitly present in the meme itself. To address this challenge, we propose KID, a Knowledge-Injected Dual-Head Learning framework for knowledge-grounded harmful meme detection. KID adopts a label-constrained distillation paradigm to decompose complex meme understanding into structured reasoning chains that explicitly link visual evidence, background knowledge, and classification labels. These chains guide the learning process by grounding external knowledge in meme-specific contexts. In addition, KID employs a dual-head architecture that jointly optimizes semantic generation and classification objectives, enabling aligned linguistic reasoning while maintaining stable decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on five multilingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, and low-resource Bengali demonstrate that KID achieves SOTA performance on both binary and multi-label harmful meme detection tasks, improving over previous best methods by 2.1%--19.7% across primary evaluation metrics. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of knowledge injection and dual-head joint learning, highlighting their complementary contributions to robust and generalizable meme understanding. The code and data are available at https://github.com/PotatoDog1669/KID.]]></description>

Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) enables parameter efficient specialization of large language models (LLMs) through modular adapters, resulting in rapidly growing public adapter pools spanning diverse tasks. Effectively using these adapters requires routing: selecting and composing the appropriate adapters for a query. We introduce LORAUTER, a novel routing framework that selects and composes LoRA adapters using task representations rather than adapter characteristics. Unlike existing approaches that map queries directly to adapters, LORAUTER routes queries via task embeddings derived from small validation sets and does not require adapter training data. By operating at the task level, LORAUTER achieves efficient routing that scales with the number of tasks rather than the number of adapters. Experiments across multiple tasks show that LORAUTER consistently outperforms baseline routing approaches, matching Oracle performance (101.2%) when task-aligned adapters exist and achieving state-of-the-art results on unseen tasks (+5.2 points). We further demonstrate the robustness of LORAUTER to very large, noisy adapter pools by scaling it to over 1500 adapters.]]></description>

Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are widely adopted for their strong multimodal capabilities, yet they raise serious concerns such as privacy leakage and harmful content generation. Machine unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for removing the influence of specific data from trained models. However, existing approaches largely rely on gradient-based optimization, incurring substantial computational costs for large-scale LVLMs. To address this limitation, we propose Knowledge Vector Weakening (KVW), a training-free unlearning method that directly intervenes in the full model without gradient computation. KVW identifies knowledge vectors that are activated during the model's output generation on the forget set and progressively weakens their contributions, thereby preventing the model from exploiting undesirable knowledge. Experiments on the MLLMU and CLEAR benchmarks demonstrate that KVW achieves a stable forget-retain trade-off while significantly improving computational efficiency over gradient-based and LoRA-based unlearning methods.]]></description>

With the rapid growth of encrypted network traffic, effective traffic classification has become essential for network security and quality of service management. Current machine learning and deep learning approaches for traffic classification face three critical challenges: computational inefficiency of Transformer architectures, inadequate traffic representations with loss of crucial byte-level features while retaining detrimental biases, and poor handling of long-tail distributions in real-world data. We propose NetMamba+, a framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1) an efficient architecture considering Mamba and Flash Attention mechanisms, (2) a multimodal traffic representation scheme that preserves essential traffic information while eliminating biases, and (3) a label distribution-aware fine-tuning strategy. Evaluation experiments on massive datasets encompassing four main classification tasks showcase NetMamba+'s superior classification performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with improvements of up to 6.44\% in F1 score. Moreover, NetMamba+ demonstrates excellent efficiency, achieving 1.7x higher inference throughput than the best baseline while maintaining comparably low memory usage. Furthermore, NetMamba+ exhibits superior few-shot learning abilities, achieving better classification performance with fewer labeled data. Additionally, we implement an online traffic classification system that demonstrates robust real-world performance with a throughput of 261.87 Mb/s. As the first framework to adapt Mamba architecture for network traffic classification, NetMamba+ opens new possibilities for efficient and accurate traffic analysis in complex network environments.]]></description>

We introduce ECSEL, an explainable classification method that learns formal expressions in the form of signomial equations, motivated by the observation that many symbolic regression benchmarks admit compact signomial structure. ECSEL directly constructs a structural, closed-form expression that serves as both a classifier and an explanation. On standard symbolic regression benchmarks, our method recovers a larger fraction of target equations than competing state-of-the-art approaches while requiring substantially less computation. Leveraging this efficiency, ECSEL achieves classification accuracy competitive with established machine learning models without sacrificing interpretability. Further, we show that ECSEL satisfies some desirable properties regarding global feature behavior, decision-boundary analysis, and local feature attributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets and two real-world case studies i.e., e-commerce and fraud detection, demonstrate that the learned equations expose dataset biases, support counterfactual reasoning, and yield actionable insights.]]></description>

The creation of Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) models is a complex and time-consuming task requiring both domain knowledge and proficiency in modeling conventions. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly expanded the possibilities for generating BPMN models directly from natural language, building upon earlier text-to-process methods with enhanced capabilities in handling complex descriptions. However, there is a lack of systematic evaluations of LLM-generated process models. Current efforts either use LLM-as-a-judge approaches or do not consider established dimensions of model quality. To this end, we introduce BEF4LLM, a novel LLM evaluation framework comprising four perspectives: syntactic quality, pragmatic quality, semantic quality, and validity. Using BEF4LLM, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of open-source LLMs and benchmark their performance against human modeling experts. Results indicate that LLMs excel in syntactic and pragmatic quality, while humans outperform in semantic aspects; however, the differences in scores are relatively modest, highlighting LLMs' competitive potential despite challenges in validity and semantic quality. The insights highlight current strengths and limitations of using LLMs for BPMN modeling and guide future model development and fine-tuning. Addressing these areas is essential for advancing the practical deployment of LLMs in business process modeling.]]></description>

Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of ships is an important part of maritime monitoring, allowing improved visualization, inspection, and decision-making in real-world monitoring environments. However, most state-ofthe-art 3D reconstruction methods require multi-view supervision, annotated 3D ground truth, or are computationally intensive, making them impractical for real-time maritime deployment. In this work, we present an efficient pipeline for single-view 3D reconstruction of real ships by training entirely on synthetic data and requiring only a single view at inference. Our approach uses the Splatter Image network, which represents objects as sparse sets of 3D Gaussians for rapid and accurate reconstruction from single images. The model is first fine-tuned on synthetic ShapeNet vessels and further refined with a diverse custom dataset of 3D ships, bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real-world imagery. We integrate a state-of-the-art segmentation module based on YOLOv8 and custom preprocessing to ensure compatibility with the reconstruction network. Postprocessing steps include real-world scaling, centering, and orientation alignment, followed by georeferenced placement on an interactive web map using AIS metadata and homography-based mapping. Quantitative evaluation on synthetic validation data demonstrates strong reconstruction fidelity, while qualitative results on real maritime images from the ShipSG dataset confirm the potential for transfer to operational maritime settings. The final system provides interactive 3D inspection of real ships without requiring real-world 3D annotations. This pipeline provides an efficient, scalable solution for maritime monitoring and highlights a path toward real-time 3D ship visualization in practical applications.

Hybrid quantum-classical learning models increasingly integrate neural networks with variational quantum circuits (VQCs) to exploit complementary inductive biases. However, many existing approaches rely on tightly coupled architectures or task-specific encoders, limiting conceptual clarity, generality, and transferability across learning settings. In this work, we introduce Quantum LEGO Learning, a modular and architecture-agnostic learning framework that treats classical and quantum components as reusable, composable learning blocks with well-defined roles. Within this framework, a pre-trained classical neural network serves as a frozen feature block, while a VQC acts as a trainable adaptive module that operates on structured representations rather than raw inputs. This separation enables efficient learning under constrained quantum resources and provides a principled abstraction for analyzing hybrid models. We develop a block-wise generalization theory that decomposes learning error into approximation and estimation components, explicitly characterizing how the complexity and training status of each block influence overall performance. Our analysis generalizes prior tensor-network-specific results and identifies conditions under which quantum modules provide representational advantages over comparably sized classical heads. Empirically, we validate the framework through systematic block-swap experiments across frozen feature extractors and both quantum and classical adaptive heads. Experiments on quantum dot classification demonstrate stable optimization, reduced sensitivity to qubit count, and robustness to realistic noise.]]></description>

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) can achieve competitive performance by converting already existing well-trained Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), avoiding further costly training. This property is particularly attractive in Reinforcement Learning (RL), where training through environment interaction is expensive and potentially unsafe. However, existing conversion methods perform poorly in continuous control, where suitable baselines are largely absent. We identify error amplification as the key cause: small action approximation errors become temporally correlated across decision steps, inducing cumulative state distribution shift and severe performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Step Residual Potential Initialization (CRPI), a lightweight training-free mechanism that carries over residual membrane potentials across decision steps to suppress temporally correlated errors. Experiments on continuous control benchmarks with both vector and visual observations demonstrate that CRPI can be integrated into existing conversion pipelines and substantially recovers lost performance. Our results highlight continuous control as a critical and challenging benchmark for ANN-to-SNN conversion, where small errors can be strongly amplified and impact performance.]]></description>

Knapsack and Top-k operators are useful for selecting discrete subsets of variables. However, their integration into neural networks is challenging as they are piecewise constant, yielding gradients that are zero almost everywhere. In this paper, we propose a unified framework casting these operators as dynamic programs, and derive differentiable relaxations by smoothing the underlying recursions. On the algorithmic side, we develop efficient parallel algorithms supporting both deterministic and stochastic forward passes, and vector-Jacobian products for the backward pass. On the theoretical side, we prove that Shannon entropy is the unique regularization choice yielding permutation-equivariant operators, and characterize regularizers inducing sparse selections. Finally, on the experimental side, we demonstrate our framework on a decision-focused learning benchmark, a constrained dynamic assortment RL problem, and an extension of discrete VAEs.]]></description>

We present a conceptual space framework for modelling abstract concepts that unfold over time, demonstrated through a chess-based proof-of-concept. Strategy concepts, such as attack or sacrifice, are represented as geometric regions across interpretable quality dimensions, with chess games instantiated and analysed as trajectories whose directional movement toward regions enables recognition of intended strategies. This approach also supports dual-perspective modelling, capturing how players interpret identical situations differently. Our implementation demonstrates the feasibility of trajectory-based concept recognition, with movement patterns aligning with expert commentary. This work explores extending the conceptual spaces theory to temporally realised, goal-directed concepts. The approach establishes a foundation for broader applications involving sequential decision-making and supports integration with knowledge evolution mechanisms for learning and refining abstract concepts over time.]]></description>

Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet they remain constrained by fixed, non-differentiable tokenizers like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), which hinder end-to-end optimization and adaptability to noisy or domain-specific data. We introduce Zonkey, a hierarchical diffusion model that addresses these limitations through a fully trainable pipeline from raw characters to document-level representations. At its core is a differentiable tokenizer (Segment Splitter) that learns probabilistic beginning-of-sequence (BOS) decisions, enabling adaptive splits that emerge as linguistically meaningful (e.g., word boundaries at spaces, sentence starts at periods) without explicit supervision. This differentiability is enabled by our novel Probabilistic Attention mechanism, which incorporates position-specific existence probabilities to simulate soft masking over theoretically infinite sequences while preserving gradients. Sequences decay probabilistically rather than relying on end-of-sequence tokens, supporting variable-length outputs. Hierarchical levels compress sequences into higher abstractions (e.g., character n-grams to word-like vectors, then sentence-like), with reconstruction via our Denoising Diffusion Mixed Model (DDMM) for stable and efficient denoising in latent space. A Stitcher ensures overlap invariance across segments. Trained end-to-end on Wikipedia, Zonkey generates coherent, variable-length text from noise, demonstrating emergent hierarchies and promising qualitative alignment to data distributions compared to entropy-based learnable tokenizers. Our approach advances toward fully gradient-based LLMs, with potential for better domain adaptation and scalable generation. We release the source code for training and reproducing our experiments.]]></description>

Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have demonstrated amazing capabilities in comprehending user intents and generate reasonable and useful responses. Beside their ability to chat, their capabilities in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks are of interest to the research community. In this paper, we focus on assessing the overall ability of ChatGPT in 4 different medical information extraction (MedIE) tasks across 6 benchmark datasets. We present the systematically analysis by measuring ChatGPT's performance, explainability, confidence, faithfulness, and uncertainty. Our experiments reveal that: (a) ChatGPT's performance scores on MedIE tasks fall behind those of the fine-tuned baseline models. (b) ChatGPT can provide high-quality explanations for its decisions, however, ChatGPT is over-confident in its predcitions. (c) ChatGPT demonstrates a high level of faithfulness to the original text in the majority of cases. (d) The uncertainty in generation causes uncertainty in information extraction results, thus may hinder its applications in MedIE tasks.]]></description>

Transformers are arguably the preferred architecture for language generation. In this paper, inspired by continued fractions, we introduce a new function class for generative modeling. The architecture family implementing this function class is named CoFrGeNets - Continued Fraction Generative Networks. We design novel architectural components based on this function class that can replace Multi-head Attention and Feed-Forward Networks in Transformer blocks while requiring much fewer parameters. We derive custom gradient formulations to optimize the proposed components more accurately and efficiently than using standard PyTorch-based gradients. Our components are a plug-in replacement requiring little change in training or inference procedures that have already been put in place for Transformer-based models thus making our approach easy to incorporate in large industrial workflows. We experiment on two very different transformer architectures GPT2-xl (1.5B) and Llama3 (3.2B), where the former we pre-train on OpenWebText and GneissWeb, while the latter we pre-train on the docling data mix which consists of nine different datasets. Results show that the performance on downstream classification, Q\& A, reasoning and text understanding tasks of our models is competitive and sometimes even superior to the original models with $\frac{2}{3}$ to $\frac{1}{2}$ the parameters and shorter pre-training time. We believe that future implementations customized to hardware will further bring out the true potential of our architectures.]]></description>

We consider Bayesian variable selection for binary outcomes under a probit link with a spike-and-slab prior on the regression coefficients. Motivated by the computational challenges encountered by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers in high-dimensional regimes, we develop a mean-field variational Bayes approximation in which all variational factors admit closed-form updates, and the evidence lower bound is available in closed form. This, in turn, allows the development of an efficient coordinate ascent variational inference algorithm to find the optimal values of the variational parameters. The approach produces posterior inclusion probabilities and parameter estimates, enabling interpretable selection and prediction within a single framework. As shown in both simulated and real data applications, the proposed method successfully identifies the important variables and is orders of magnitude faster than MCMC, while maintaining comparable accuracy.]]></description>

Conventional supervised climate downscaling struggles to generalize to Global Climate Models (GCMs) due to the lack of paired training data and inherent domain gaps relative to reanalysis. Meanwhile, current zero-shot methods suffer from physical inconsistencies and vanishing gradient issues under large scaling factors. We propose Zero-Shot Statistical Downscaling (ZSSD), a zero-shot framework that performs statistical downscaling without paired data during training. ZSSD leverages a Physics-Consistent Climate Prior learned from reanalysis data, conditioned on geophysical boundaries and temporal information to enforce physical validity. Furthermore, to enable robust inference across varying GCMs, we introduce Unified Coordinate Guidance. This strategy addresses the vanishing gradient problem in vanilla DPS and ensures consistency with large-scale fields. Results show that ZSSD significantly outperforms existing zero-shot baselines in 99th percentile errors and successfully reconstructs complex weather events, such as tropical cyclones, across heterogeneous GCMs.]]></description>

General-purpose open-domain dense retrieval systems are usually trained with a large, eclectic mix of corpora and search tasks. How should these diverse corpora and tasks be sampled for training? Conventional approaches sample them uniformly, proportional to their instance population sizes, or depend on human-level expert supervision. It is well known that the training data sampling strategy can greatly impact model performance. However, how to find the optimal strategy has not been adequately studied in the context of embedding models. We propose Inf-DDS, a novel reinforcement learning driven sampling framework that adaptively reweighs training datasets guided by influence-based reward signals and is much more lightweight with respect to GPU consumption. Our technique iteratively refines the sampling policy, prioritizing datasets that maximize model performance on a target development set. We evaluate the efficacy of our sampling strategy on a wide range of text retrieval tasks, demonstrating strong improvements in retrieval performance and better adaptation compared to existing gradient-based sampling methods, while also being 1.5x to 4x cheaper in GPU compute. Our sampling strategy achieves a 5.03 absolute NDCG@10 improvement while training a multilingual bge-m3 model and an absolute NDCG@10 improvement of 0.94 while training all-MiniLM-L6-v2, even when starting from expert-assigned weights on a large pool of training datasets.]]></description>

AI assistance produces significant productivity gains across professional domains, particularly for novice workers. Yet how this assistance affects the development of skills required to effectively supervise AI remains unclear. Novice workers who rely heavily on AI to complete unfamiliar tasks may compromise their own skill acquisition in the process. We conduct randomized experiments to study how developers gained mastery of a new asynchronous programming library with and without the assistance of AI. We find that AI use impairs conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging abilities, without delivering significant efficiency gains on average. Participants who fully delegated coding tasks showed some productivity improvements, but at the cost of learning the library. We identify six distinct AI interaction patterns, three of which involve cognitive engagement and preserve learning outcomes even when participants receive AI assistance. Our findings suggest that AI-enhanced productivity is not a shortcut to competence and AI assistance should be carefully adopted into workflows to preserve skill formation -- particularly in safety-critical domains.]]></description>
