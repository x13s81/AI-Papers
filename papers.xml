The construction of World Models capable of learning, simulating, and reasoning about objective physical laws constitutes a foundational challenge in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence. Recent advancements represented by video generation models like Sora have demonstrated the potential of data-driven scaling laws to approximate physical dynamics, while the emerging Unified Multimodal Model (UMM) offers a promising architectural paradigm for integrating perception, language, and reasoning. Despite these advances, the field still lacks a principled theoretical framework that defines the essential properties requisite for a General World Model. In this paper, we propose that a World Model must be grounded in the Trinity of Consistency: Modal Consistency as the semantic interface, Spatial Consistency as the geometric basis, and Temporal Consistency as the causal engine. Through this tripartite lens, we systematically review the evolution of multimodal learning, revealing a trajectory from loosely coupled specialized modules toward unified architectures that enable the synergistic emergence of internal world simulators. To complement this conceptual framework, we introduce CoW-Bench, a benchmark centered on multi-frame reasoning and generation scenarios. CoW-Bench evaluates both video generation models and UMMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our work establishes a principled pathway toward general world models, clarifying both the limitations of current systems and the architectural requirements for future progress.]]></description>

Instruction-based image editing has achieved remarkable success in semantic alignment, yet state-of-the-art models frequently fail to render physically plausible results when editing involves complex causal dynamics, such as refraction or material deformation. We attribute this limitation to the dominant paradigm that treats editing as a discrete mapping between image pairs, which provides only boundary conditions and leaves transition dynamics underspecified. To address this, we reformulate physics-aware editing as predictive physical state transitions and introduce PhysicTran38K, a large-scale video-based dataset comprising 38K transition trajectories across five physical domains, constructed via a two-stage filtering and constraint-aware annotation pipeline. Building on this supervision, we propose PhysicEdit, an end-to-end framework equipped with a textual-visual dual-thinking mechanism. It combines a frozen Qwen2.5-VL for physically grounded reasoning with learnable transition queries that provide timestep-adaptive visual guidance to a diffusion backbone. Experiments show that PhysicEdit improves over Qwen-Image-Edit by 5.9% in physical realism and 10.1% in knowledge-grounded editing, setting a new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, while remaining competitive with leading proprietary models.]]></description>

Rigorously evaluating machine intelligence against the broad spectrum of human general intelligence has become increasingly important and challenging in this era of rapid technological advance. Conventional AI benchmarks typically assess only narrow capabilities in a limited range of human activity. Most are also static, quickly saturating as developers explicitly or implicitly optimize for them. We propose that a more promising way to evaluate human-like general intelligence in AI systems is through a particularly strong form of general game playing: studying how and how well they play and learn to play all conceivable human games, in comparison to human players with the same level of experience, time, or other resources. We define a "human game" to be a game designed by humans for humans, and argue for the evaluative suitability of this space of all such games people can imagine and enjoy -- the "Multiverse of Human Games". Taking a first step towards this vision, we introduce the AI GameStore, a scalable and open-ended platform that uses LLMs with humans-in-the-loop to synthesize new representative human games, by automatically sourcing and adapting standardized and containerized variants of game environments from popular human digital gaming platforms. As a proof of concept, we generated 100 such games based on the top charts of Apple App Store and Steam, and evaluated seven frontier vision-language models (VLMs) on short episodes of play. The best models achieved less than 10\% of the human average score on the majority of the games, and especially struggled with games that challenge world-model learning, memory and planning. We conclude with a set of next steps for building out the AI GameStore as a practical way to measure and drive progress toward human-like general intelligence in machines.]]></description>

As Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) scale up and reinforcement learning (RL) methods mature, LMMs have made notable progress in complex reasoning and decision making. Yet training still relies on static data and fixed recipes, making it difficult to diagnose capability blind spots or provide dynamic, targeted reinforcement. Motivated by findings that test driven error exposure and feedback based correction outperform repetitive practice, we propose Diagnostic-driven Progressive Evolution (DPE), a spiral loop where diagnosis steers data generation and reinforcement, and each iteration re-diagnoses the updated model to drive the next round of targeted improvement. DPE has two key components. First, multiple agents annotate and quality control massive unlabeled multimodal data, using tools such as web search and image editing to produce diverse, realistic samples. Second, DPE attributes failures to specific weaknesses, dynamically adjusts the data mixture, and guides agents to generate weakness focused data for targeted reinforcement. Experiments on Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct show stable, continual gains across eleven benchmarks, indicating DPE as a scalable paradigm for continual LMM training under open task distributions. Our code, models, and data are publicly available at https://github.com/hongruijia/DPE.]]></description>

Molecular generation with diffusion models has emerged as a promising direction for AI-driven drug discovery and materials science. While graph diffusion models have been widely adopted due to the discrete nature of 2D molecular graphs, existing models suffer from low chemical validity and struggle to meet the desired properties compared to 1D modeling. In this work, we introduce MolHIT, a powerful molecular graph generation framework that overcomes long-standing performance limitations in existing methods. MolHIT is based on the Hierarchical Discrete Diffusion Model, which generalizes discrete diffusion to additional categories that encode chemical priors, and decoupled atom encoding that splits the atom types according to their chemical roles. Overall, MolHIT achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the MOSES dataset with near-perfect validity for the first time in graph diffusion, surpassing strong 1D baselines across multiple metrics. We further demonstrate strong performance in downstream tasks, including multi-property guided generation and scaffold extension.]]></description>

We introduce MediX-R1, an open-ended Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for medical multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that enables clinically grounded, free-form answers beyond multiple-choice formats. MediX-R1 fine-tunes a baseline vision-language backbone with Group Based RL and a composite reward tailored for medical reasoning: an LLM-based accuracy reward that judges semantic correctness with a strict YES/NO decision, a medical embedding-based semantic reward to capture paraphrases and terminology variants, and lightweight format and modality rewards that enforce interpretable reasoning and modality recognition. This multi-signal design provides stable, informative feedback for open-ended outputs where traditional verifiable or MCQ-only rewards fall short. To measure progress, we propose a unified evaluation framework for both text-only and image+text tasks that uses a Reference-based LLM-as-judge in place of brittle string-overlap metrics, capturing semantic correctness, reasoning, and contextual alignment. Despite using only sim51K instruction examples, MediX-R1 achieves excellent results across standard medical LLM (text-only) and VLM (image + text) benchmarks, outperforming strong open-source baselines and delivering particularly large gains on open-ended clinical tasks. Our results demonstrate that open-ended RL with comprehensive reward signals and LLM-based evaluation is a practical path toward reliable medical reasoning in multimodal models. Our trained models, curated datasets and source code are available at https://medix.cvmbzuai.com]]></description>

We present a scalable 3D reconstruction model that addresses a critical limitation in offline feed-forward methods: their computational and memory requirements grow quadratically w.r.t. the number of input images. Our approach is built on the key insight that this bottleneck stems from the varying-length Key-Value (KV) space representation of scene geometry, which we distill into a fixed-size Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) via test-time training. VGG-T^3 (Visual Geometry Grounded Test Time Training) scales linearly w.r.t. the number of input views, similar to online models, and reconstructs a 1k image collection in just 54 seconds, achieving a 11.6times speed-up over baselines that rely on softmax attention. Since our method retains global scene aggregation capability, our point map reconstruction error outperforming other linear-time methods by large margins. Finally, we demonstrate visual localization capabilities of our model by querying the scene representation with unseen images.]]></description>

Human behaviors in the real world naturally encode rich, long-term contextual information that can be leveraged to train embodied agents for perception, understanding, and acting. However, existing capture systems typically rely on costly studio setups and wearable devices, limiting the large-scale collection of scene-conditioned human motion data in the wild. To address this, we propose EmbodMocap, a portable and affordable data collection pipeline using two moving iPhones. Our key idea is to jointly calibrate dual RGB-D sequences to reconstruct both humans and scenes within a unified metric world coordinate frame. The proposed method allows metric-scale and scene-consistent capture in everyday environments without static cameras or markers, bridging human motion and scene geometry seamlessly. Compared with optical capture ground truth, we demonstrate that the dual-view setting exhibits a remarkable ability to mitigate depth ambiguity, achieving superior alignment and reconstruction performance over single iphone or monocular models. Based on the collected data, we empower three embodied AI tasks: monocular human-scene-reconstruction, where we fine-tune on feedforward models that output metric-scale, world-space aligned humans and scenes; physics-based character animation, where we prove our data could be used to scale human-object interaction skills and scene-aware motion tracking; and robot motion control, where we train a humanoid robot via sim-to-real RL to replicate human motions depicted in videos. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our pipeline and its contributions towards advancing embodied AI research.]]></description>

Open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) extends the zero-shot recognition capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) to pixel-level prediction, enabling segmentation of arbitrary categories specified by text prompts. Despite recent progress, OVS lags behind fully supervised approaches due to two challenges: the coarse image-level supervision used to train VLMs and the semantic ambiguity of natural language. We address these limitations by introducing a few-shot setting that augments textual prompts with a support set of pixel-annotated images. Building on this, we propose a retrieval-augmented test-time adapter that learns a lightweight, per-image classifier by fusing textual and visual support features. Unlike prior methods relying on late, hand-crafted fusion, our approach performs learned, per-query fusion, achieving stronger synergy between modalities. The method supports continually expanding support sets, and applies to fine-grained tasks such as personalized segmentation. Experiments show that we significantly narrow the gap between zero-shot and supervised segmentation while preserving open-vocabulary ability.]]></description>

Energy-based predictive world models provide a powerful approach for multi-step visual planning by reasoning over latent energy landscapes rather than generating pixels. However, existing approaches face two major challenges: (i) their latent representations are typically learned in Euclidean space, neglecting the underlying geometric and hierarchical structure among states, and (ii) they struggle with long-horizon prediction, which leads to rapid degradation across extended rollouts. To address these challenges, we introduce GeoWorld, a geometric world model that preserves geometric structure and hierarchical relations through a Hyperbolic JEPA, which maps latent representations from Euclidean space onto hyperbolic manifolds. We further introduce Geometric Reinforcement Learning for energy-based optimization, enabling stable multi-step planning in hyperbolic latent space. Extensive experiments on CrossTask and COIN demonstrate around 3% SR improvement in 3-step planning and 2% SR improvement in 4-step planning compared to the state-of-the-art V-JEPA 2.

GPU kernel optimization is fundamental to modern deep learning but remains a highly specialized task requiring deep hardware expertise. Despite strong performance in general programming, large language models (LLMs) remain uncompetitive with compiler-based systems such as torch.compile for CUDA kernel generation. Existing CUDA code generation approaches either rely on training-free refinement or fine-tune models within fixed multi-turn execution-feedback loops, but both paradigms fail to fundamentally improve the model's intrinsic CUDA optimization ability, resulting in limited performance gains. We present CUDA Agent, a large-scale agentic reinforcement learning system that develops CUDA kernel expertise through three components: a scalable data synthesis pipeline, a skill-augmented CUDA development environment with automated verification and profiling to provide reliable reward signals, and reinforcement learning algorithmic techniques enabling stable training. CUDA Agent achieves state-of-the-art results on KernelBench, delivering 100\%, 100\%, and 92\% faster rate over torch.compile on KernelBench Level-1, Level-2, and Level-3 splits, outperforming the strongest proprietary models such as Claude Opus 4.5 and Gemini 3 Pro by about 40\% on the hardest Level-3 setting.]]></description>

We systematically evaluate the quality of widely used AI safety datasets from two perspectives: in isolation and in practice. In isolation, we examine how well these datasets reflect real-world adversarial attacks based on three key properties: being driven by ulterior intent, well-crafted, and out-of-distribution. We find that these datasets overrely on "triggering cues": words or phrases with overt negative/sensitive connotations that are intended to trigger safety mechanisms explicitly, which is unrealistic compared to real-world attacks. In practice, we evaluate whether these datasets genuinely measure safety risks or merely provoke refusals through triggering cues. To explore this, we introduce "intent laundering": a procedure that abstracts away triggering cues from adversarial attacks (data points) while strictly preserving their malicious intent and all relevant details. Our results indicate that current AI safety datasets fail to faithfully represent real-world adversarial behavior due to their overreliance on triggering cues. Once these cues are removed, all previously evaluated "reasonably safe" models become unsafe, including Gemini 3 Pro and Claude Sonnet 3.7. Moreover, when intent laundering is adapted as a jailbreaking technique, it consistently achieves high attack success rates, ranging from 90% to over 98%, under fully black-box access. Overall, our findings expose a significant disconnect between how model safety is evaluated by existing datasets and how real-world adversaries behave.]]></description>

Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse problems. While computed tomography (CT) is theoretically a linear inverse problem, it poses many practical challenges. These include correlated noise, artifact structures, reliance on system geometry, and misaligned value ranges, which make the direct application of diffusion models more difficult than in domains like natural image generation. To systematically evaluate how diffusion models perform in this context and compare them with established reconstruction methods, we introduce DM4CT, a comprehensive benchmark for CT reconstruction. DM4CT includes datasets from both medical and industrial domains with sparse-view and noisy configurations. To explore the challenges of deploying diffusion models in practice, we additionally acquire a high-resolution CT dataset at a high-energy synchrotron facility and evaluate all methods under real experimental conditions. We benchmark ten recent diffusion-based methods alongside seven strong baselines, including model-based, unsupervised, and supervised approaches. Our analysis provides detailed insights into the behavior, strengths, and limitations of diffusion models for CT reconstruction. The real-world dataset is publicly available at zenodo.org/records/15420527, and the codebase is open-sourced at github.com/DM4CT/DM4CT.]]></description>

Human intelligence naturally intertwines omni-modal perception -- spanning vision, audio, and language -- with complex reasoning and tool usage to interact with the world. However, current multi-modal LLMs are primarily confined to bi-modal interactions (e.g., vision-language), lacking the unified cognitive capabilities required for general AI assistants. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniGAIA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate omni-modal agents on tasks necessitating deep reasoning and multi-turn tool execution across video, audio, and image modalities. Constructed via a novel omni-modal event graph approach, OmniGAIA synthesizes complex, multi-hop queries derived from real-world data that require cross-modal reasoning and external tool integration. Furthermore, we propose OmniAtlas, a native omni-modal foundation agent under tool-integrated reasoning paradigm with active omni-modal perception. Trained on trajectories synthesized via a hindsight-guided tree exploration strategy and OmniDPO for fine-grained error correction, OmniAtlas effectively enhances the tool-use capabilities of existing open-source models. This work marks a step towards next-generation native omni-modal AI assistants for real-world scenarios.]]></description>

The performance of multi-turn, agentic LLM inference is increasingly dominated by KV-Cache storage I/O rather than computation. In prevalent disaggregated architectures, loading the massive KV-Cache from external storage creates a fundamental imbalance: storage NICs on prefill engines become bandwidth-saturated, while those on decoding engines remain idle. This asymmetry severely constrains overall system throughput.
  We present DualPath, an inference system that breaks this bottleneck by introducing dual-path KV-Cache loading. Beyond the traditional storage-to-prefill path, DualPath enables a novel storage-to-decode path, in which the KV-Cache is loaded into decoding engines and then efficiently transferred to prefill engines via RDMA over the compute network. DualPath combines this optimized data path -- which inherently avoids network congestion and avoids interference with latency-critical model execution communications -- with a global scheduler that dynamically balances load across prefill and decode engines.
  Our evaluation on three models with production agentic workloads demonstrates that DualPath improves offline inference throughput by up to 1.87times on our in-house inference system. It can also improve online serving throughput by an average factor of 1.96times without violating SLO.]]></description>

Recent deep research agents primarily improve performance by scaling reasoning depth, but this leads to high inference cost and latency in search-intensive scenarios. Moreover, generalization across heterogeneous research settings remains challenging. In this work, we propose Search More, Think Less (SMTL), a framework for long-horizon agentic search that targets both efficiency and generalization. SMTL replaces sequential reasoning with parallel evidence acquisition, enabling efficient context management under constrained context budgets. To support generalization across task types, we further introduce a unified data synthesis pipeline that constructs search tasks spanning both deterministic question answering and open-ended research scenarios with task appropriate evaluation metrics. We train an end-to-end agent using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, achieving strong and often state of the art performance across benchmarks including BrowseComp (48.6\%), GAIA (75.7\%), Xbench (82.0\%), and DeepResearch Bench (45.9\%). Compared to Mirothinker-v1.0, SMTL with maximum 100 interaction steps reduces the average number of reasoning steps on BrowseComp by 70.7\%, while improving accuracy.]]></description>

Medical image segmentation remains challenging due to limited annotations for training, ambiguous anatomical features, and domain shifts. While vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong cross-modal representations, their potential for dense, text-guided medical image segmentation remains underexplored. We present MedCLIPSeg, a novel framework that adapts CLIP for robust, data-efficient, and uncertainty-aware medical image segmentation. Our approach leverages patch-level CLIP embeddings through probabilistic cross-modal attention, enabling bidirectional interaction between image and text tokens and explicit modeling of predictive uncertainty. Together with a soft patch-level contrastive loss that encourages more nuanced semantic learning across diverse textual prompts, MedCLIPSeg effectively improves data efficiency and domain generalizability. Extensive experiments across 16 datasets spanning five imaging modalities and six organs demonstrate that MedCLIPSeg outperforms prior methods in accuracy, efficiency, and robustness, while providing interpretable uncertainty maps that highlight local reliability of segmentation results. This work demonstrates the potential of probabilistic vision-language modeling for text-driven medical image segmentation.]]></description>

With advances in imitation learning (IL) and large-scale driving datasets, end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has made great progress recently. Currently, IL-based methods have become a mainstream paradigm: models rely on standard driving behaviors given by experts, and learn to minimize the discrepancy between their actions and expert actions. However, this objective of "only driving like the expert" suffers from limited generalization: when encountering rare or unseen long-tail scenarios outside the distribution of expert demonstrations, models tend to produce unsafe decisions in the absence of prior experience. This raises a fundamental question: Can an E2E-AD system make reliable decisions without any expert action supervision? Motivated by this, we propose a unified framework named Risk-aware World Model Predictive Control (RaWMPC) to address this generalization dilemma through robust control, without reliance on expert demonstrations. Practically, RaWMPC leverages a world model to predict the consequences of multiple candidate actions and selects low-risk actions through explicit risk evaluation. To endow the world model with the ability to predict the outcomes of risky driving behaviors, we design a risk-aware interaction strategy that systematically exposes the world model to hazardous behaviors, making catastrophic outcomes predictable and thus avoidable. Furthermore, to generate low-risk candidate actions at test time, we introduce a self-evaluation distillation method to distill riskavoidance capabilities from the well-trained world model into a generative action proposal network without any expert demonstration. Extensive experiments show that RaWMPC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, while providing superior decision interpretability.]]></description>

Transformers have been established as the de-facto backbones for most recent advances in sequence modeling, mainly due to their growing memory capacity that scales with the context length. While plausible for retrieval tasks, it causes quadratic complexity and so has motivated recent studies to explore viable subquadratic recurrent alternatives. Despite showing promising preliminary results in diverse domains, such recurrent architectures underperform Transformers in recall-intensive tasks, often attributed to their fixed-size memory. In this paper, we introduce Memory Caching (MC), a simple yet effective technique that enhances recurrent models by caching checkpoints of their memory states (a.k.a. hidden states). Memory Caching allows the effective memory capacity of RNNs to grow with sequence length, offering a flexible trade-off that interpolates between the fixed memory (i.e., O(L) complexity) of RNNs and the growing memory (i.e., O(L^2) complexity) of Transformers. We propose four variants of MC, including gated aggregation and sparse selective mechanisms, and discuss their implications on both linear and deep memory modules. Our experimental results on language modeling, and long-context understanding tasks show that MC enhances the performance of recurrent models, supporting its effectiveness. The results of in-context recall tasks indicate that while Transformers achieve the best accuracy, our MC variants show competitive performance, close the gap with Transformers, and performs better than state-of-the-art recurrent models.]]></description>

Data-efficient neural decoding is a central challenge for speech brain-computer interfaces. We present the first demonstration of transfer learning and cross-task decoding for MEG-based speech models spanning perception and production. We pre-train a Conformer-based model on 50 hours of single-subject listening data and fine-tune on just 5 minutes per subject across 18 participants. Transfer learning yields consistent improvements, with in-task accuracy gains of 1-4% and larger cross-task gains of up to 5-6%. Not only does pre-training improve performance within each task, but it also enables reliable cross-task decoding between perception and production. Critically, models trained on speech production decode passive listening above chance, confirming that learned representations reflect shared neural processes rather than task-specific motor activity.]]></description>

Large language models (LLMs) have been reported to linearly encode truthfulness, yet recent work questions this finding's generality. We reconcile these views with the truthfulness spectrum hypothesis: the representational space contains directions ranging from broadly domain-general to narrowly domain-specific. To test this hypothesis, we systematically evaluate probe generalization across five truth types (definitional, empirical, logical, fictional, and ethical), sycophantic and expectation-inverted lying, and existing honesty benchmarks. Linear probes generalize well across most domains but fail on sycophantic and expectation-inverted lying. Yet training on all domains jointly recovers strong performance, confirming that domain-general directions exist despite poor pairwise transfer. The geometry of probe directions explains these patterns: Mahalanobis cosine similarity between probes near-perfectly predicts cross-domain generalization (R^2=0.98). Concept-erasure methods further isolate truth directions that are (1) domain-general, (2) domain-specific, or (3) shared only across particular domain subsets. Causal interventions reveal that domain-specific directions steer more effectively than domain-general ones. Finally, post-training reshapes truth geometry, pushing sycophantic lying further from other truth types, suggesting a representational basis for chat models' sycophantic tendencies. Together, our results support the truthfulness spectrum hypothesis: truth directions of varying generality coexist in representational space, with post-training reshaping their geometry. Code for all experiments is provided in https://github.com/zfying/truth_spec.]]></description>

Diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art video generation quality, but their inference remains expensive due to the large number of sequential denoising steps. This has motivated a growing line of research on accelerating diffusion inference. Among training-free acceleration methods, caching reduces computation by reusing previously computed model outputs across timesteps. Existing caching methods rely on heuristic criteria to choose cache/reuse timesteps and require extensive tuning. We address this limitation with a principled sensitivity-aware caching framework. Specifically, we formalize the caching error through an analysis of the model output sensitivity to perturbations in the denoising inputs, i.e., the noisy latent and the timestep, and show that this sensitivity is a key predictor of caching error. Based on this analysis, we propose Sensitivity-Aware Caching (SenCache), a dynamic caching policy that adaptively selects caching timesteps on a per-sample basis. Our framework provides a theoretical basis for adaptive caching, explains why prior empirical heuristics can be partially effective, and extends them to a dynamic, sample-specific approach. Experiments on Wan 2.1, CogVideoX, and LTX-Video show that SenCache achieves better visual quality than existing caching methods under similar computational budgets.]]></description>

Continual learning is a core requirement for deployed language models, yet standard training and fine-tuning pipelines remain brittle under non-stationary data. Online updates often induce catastrophic forgetting, while methods that improve stability frequently increase latency, memory footprint, or dense computation in ways that do not scale well to long contexts. We introduce TRC^{2} (Thalamically Routed Cortical Columns), a decoder-only backbone that addresses continual learning at the architectural level. TRC^{2} combines sparse thalamic routing over cortical columns with mechanisms for modulation, prediction, memory, and feedback, together with a fast corrective pathway that supports rapid adaptation without destabilizing slower parameters. The resulting block is sparse and chunk-parallel, enabling efficient training and inference while preserving clean ablations of each subsystem. We instantiate a reproducible training and evaluation stack and a continual-learning harness that measures proxy forgetting under streaming domain shifts. Across language modeling and continual learning benchmarks, TRC^{2} improves the stability-plasticity tradeoff at comparable compute, enabling rapid on-stream adaptation while preserving previously acquired behavior.]]></description>

Route-planning agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for supporting everyday human mobility through natural language interaction and tool-mediated decision making. However, systematic evaluation in real-world mobility settings is hindered by diverse routing demands, non-deterministic mapping services, and limited reproducibility. In this study, we introduce MobilityBench, a scalable benchmark for evaluating LLM-based route-planning agents in real-world mobility scenarios. MobilityBench is constructed from large-scale, anonymized real user queries collected from Amap and covers a broad spectrum of route-planning intents across multiple cities worldwide. To enable reproducible, end-to-end evaluation, we design a deterministic API-replay sandbox that eliminates environmental variance from live services. We further propose a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol centered on outcome validity, complemented by assessments of instruction understanding, planning, tool use, and efficiency. Using MobilityBench, we evaluate multiple LLM-based route-planning agents across diverse real-world mobility scenarios and provide an in-depth analysis of their behaviors and performance. Our findings reveal that current models perform competently on Basic information retrieval and Route Planning tasks, yet struggle considerably with Preference-Constrained Route Planning, underscoring significant room for improvement in personalized mobility applications. We publicly release the benchmark data, evaluation toolkit, and documentation at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/MobilityBench .]]></description>

Exploration remains the key bottleneck for large language model agents trained with reinforcement learning. While prior methods exploit pretrained knowledge, they fail in environments requiring the discovery of novel states. We propose Exploratory Memory-Augmented On- and Off-Policy Optimization (EMPO^2), a hybrid RL framework that leverages memory for exploration and combines on- and off-policy updates to make LLMs perform well with memory while also ensuring robustness without it. On ScienceWorld and WebShop, EMPO^2 achieves 128.6% and 11.3% improvements over GRPO, respectively. Moreover, in out-of-distribution tests, EMPO^2 demonstrates superior adaptability to new tasks, requiring only a few trials with memory and no parameter updates. These results highlight EMPO^2 as a promising framework for building more exploratory and generalizable LLM-based agents.]]></description>

While Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel in complex reasoning, they suffer from the cascading impact of erroneous information generated by individual participants. Current solutions often resort to rigid structural engineering or expensive fine-tuning, limiting their deployability and adaptability. We propose AgentDropoutV2, a test-time rectify-or-reject pruning framework designed to dynamically optimize MAS information flow without retraining. Our approach acts as an active firewall, intercepting agent outputs and employing a retrieval-augmented rectifier to iteratively correct errors based on a failure-driven indicator pool. This mechanism allows for the precise identification of potential errors using distilled failure patterns as prior knowledge. Irreparable outputs are subsequently pruned to prevent error propagation, while a fallback strategy preserves system integrity. Empirical results on extensive math benchmarks show that AgentDropoutV2 significantly boosts the MAS's task performance, achieving an average accuracy gain of 6.3 percentage points on math benchmarks. Furthermore, the system exhibits robust generalization and adaptivity, dynamically modulating rectification efforts based on task difficulty while leveraging context-aware indicators to resolve a wide spectrum of error patterns. Our code and dataset are released at https://github.com/TonySY2/AgentDropoutV2.]]></description>

Vector glyphs are the atomic units of digital typography, yet most learning-based pipelines still depend on carefully curated exemplar sheets and raster-to-vector postprocessing, which limits accessibility and editability. We introduce VecGlypher, a single multimodal language model that generates high-fidelity vector glyphs directly from text descriptions or image exemplars. Given a style prompt, optional reference glyph images, and a target character, VecGlypher autoregressively emits SVG path tokens, avoiding raster intermediates and producing editable, watertight outlines in one pass. A typography-aware data and training recipe makes this possible: (i) a large-scale continuation stage on 39K noisy Envato fonts to master SVG syntax and long-horizon geometry, followed by (ii) post-training on 2.5K expert-annotated Google Fonts with descriptive tags and exemplars to align language and imagery with geometry; preprocessing normalizes coordinate frames, canonicalizes paths, de-duplicates families, and quantizes coordinates for stable long-sequence decoding. On cross-family OOD evaluation, VecGlypher substantially outperforms both general-purpose LLMs and specialized vector-font baselines for text-only generation, while image-referenced generation reaches a state-of-the-art performance, with marked gains over DeepVecFont-v2 and DualVector. Ablations show that model scale and the two-stage recipe are critical and that absolute-coordinate serialization yields the best geometry. VecGlypher lowers the barrier to font creation by letting users design with words or exemplars, and provides a scalable foundation for future multimodal design tools.]]></description>

The promise of general-purpose agents - systems that perform tasks in unfamiliar environments without domain-specific engineering - remains largely unrealized. Existing agents are predominantly specialized, and while emerging implementations like OpenAI SDK Agent and Claude Code hint at broader capabilities, no systematic evaluation of their general performance has been pursued. Current agentic benchmarks assume domain-specific integration, encoding task information in ways that preclude fair evaluation of general agents. This paper frames general-agent evaluation as a first-class research objective. We propose conceptual principles for such evaluation, a Unified Protocol enabling agent-benchmark integration, and Exgentic - a practical framework for general agent evaluation. We benchmark five prominent agent implementations across six environments as the first Open General Agent Leaderboard. Our experiments show that general agents generalize across diverse environments, achieving performance comparable to domain-specific agents without any environment-specific tuning. We release our evaluation protocol, framework, and leaderboard to establish a foundation for systematic research on general-purpose agents.]]></description>

Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP), also known as ZeRO, is widely used for training large-scale models, featuring its flexibility and minimal intrusion on model code. However, current FSDP systems struggle with structure-aware training methods (e.g., block-wise quantized training) and with non-element-wise optimizers (e.g., Shampoo and Muon) used in cutting-edge models (e.g., Gemini, Kimi K2). FSDP's fixed element- or row-wise sharding formats conflict with the block-structured computations. In addition, today's implementations fall short in communication and memory efficiency, limiting scaling to tens of thousands of GPUs. We introduce veScale-FSDP, a redesigned FSDP system that couples a flexible sharding format, RaggedShard, with a structure-aware planning algorithm to deliver both flexibility and performance at scale. veScale-FSDP natively supports efficient data placement required by FSDP, empowering block-wise quantization and non-element-wise optimizers. As a result, veScale-FSDP achieves 5~66% higher throughput and 16~30% lower memory usage than existing FSDP systems, while scaling efficiently to tens of thousands of GPUs.]]></description>

Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become the leading paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, standard RLVR algorithms suffer from a well-documented pathology: while they improve Pass@1 accuracy through sharpened sampling, they simultaneously narrow the model's reasoning boundary and reduce generation diversity. We identify a root cause that existing methods overlook: the uniform penalization of errors. Current approaches -- whether data-filtering methods that select prompts by difficulty, or advantage normalization schemes -- treat all incorrect rollouts within a group identically. We show that this uniformity allows overconfident errors (incorrect reasoning paths that the RL process has spuriously reinforced) to persist and monopolize probability mass, ultimately suppressing valid exploratory trajectories. To address this, we propose the Asymmetric Confidence-aware Error Penalty (ACE). ACE introduces a per-rollout confidence shift metric, c_i = log(pi_theta(y_i|x) / pi_ref(y_i|x)), to dynamically modulate negative advantages. Theoretically, we demonstrate that ACE's gradient can be decomposed into the gradient of a selective regularizer restricted to overconfident errors, plus a well-characterized residual that partially moderates the regularizer's strength. We conduct extensive experiments fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen3-8B-Base, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the DAPO-Math-17K dataset using GRPO and DAPO within the VERL framework. Evaluated on MATH-500 and AIME 2025, ACE composes seamlessly with existing methods and consistently improves the full Pass@k spectrum across all three model families and benchmarks.]]></description>

Hepatocellular Carcinoma diagnosis relies heavily on the interpretation of gigapixel Whole Slide Images. However, current computational approaches are constrained by fixed-resolution processing mechanisms and inefficient feature aggregation, which inevitably lead to either severe information loss or high feature redundancy. To address these challenges, we propose Hepato-LLaVA, a specialized Multi-modal Large Language Model designed for fine-grained hepatocellular pathology analysis. We introduce a novel Sparse Topo-Pack Attention mechanism that explicitly models 2D tissue topology. This mechanism effectively aggregates local diagnostic evidence into semantic summary tokens while preserving global context. Furthermore, to overcome the lack of multi-scale data, we present HepatoPathoVQA, a clinically grounded dataset comprising 33K hierarchically structured question-answer pairs validated by expert pathologists. Our experiments demonstrate that Hepato-LLaVA achieves state-of-the-art performance on HCC diagnosis and captioning tasks, significantly outperforming existing methods. Our code and implementation details are available at https://pris-cv.github.io/Hepto-LLaVA/.]]></description>

Masked Image Generation Models (MIGMs) have achieved great success, yet their efficiency is hampered by the multiple steps of bi-directional attention. In fact, there exists notable redundancy in their computation: when sampling discrete tokens, the rich semantics contained in the continuous features are lost. Some existing works attempt to cache the features to approximate future features. However, they exhibit considerable approximation error under aggressive acceleration rates. We attribute this to their limited expressivity and the failure to account for sampling information. To fill this gap, we propose to learn a lightweight model that incorporates both previous features and sampled tokens, and regresses the average velocity field of feature evolution. The model has moderate complexity that suffices to capture the subtle dynamics while keeping lightweight compared to the original base model. We apply our method, MIGM-Shortcut, to two representative MIGM architectures and tasks. In particular, on the state-of-the-art Lumina-DiMOO, it achieves over 4x acceleration of text-to-image generation while maintaining quality, significantly pushing the Pareto frontier of masked image generation. The code and model weights are available at https://github.com/Kaiwen-Zhu/MIGM-Shortcut.]]></description>

Large Language Model (LLM) hallucinations are usually treated as defects of the model or its decoding strategy. Drawing on classical linguistics, we argue that a query's form can also shape a listener's (and model's) response. We operationalize this insight by constructing a 22-dimension query feature vector covering clause complexity, lexical rarity, and anaphora, negation, answerability, and intention grounding, all known to affect human comprehension. Using 369,837 real-world queries, we ask: Are there certain types of queries that make hallucination more likely? A large-scale analysis reveals a consistent "risk landscape": certain features such as deep clause nesting and underspecification align with higher hallucination propensity. In contrast, clear intention grounding and answerability align with lower hallucination rates. Others, including domain specificity, show mixed, dataset- and model-dependent effects. Thus, these findings establish an empirically observable query-feature representation correlated with hallucination risk, paving the way for guided query rewriting and future intervention studies.]]></description>

We introduce ISO-Bench, a benchmark for coding agents to test their capabilities on real-world inference optimization tasks. These tasks were taken from vLLM and SGLang, two of the most popular LLM serving frameworks. Each task provides an agent with a codebase and bottleneck description, whereby the agent must produce an optimization patch evaluated against expert human solutions. We curated 54 tasks from merged pull requests with measurable performance improvements. While existing benchmarks heavily use runtime-based metrics, such approaches can be gamed to pass tests without capturing the actual intent of the code changes. Therefore, we combine both hard (execution-based) and soft (LLM-based) metrics to show that both are necessary for complete evaluation. While evaluating both closed and open-source coding agents, we find no single agent dominates across codebases. Surprisingly, agents often identify correct bottlenecks but fail to execute working solutions. We also show that agents with identical underlying models differ substantially, suggesting scaffolding is as important as the model.]]></description>

Extracting clinical information from medical transcripts in low-resource languages remains a significant challenge in healthcare natural language processing (NLP). This study evaluates a two-step pipeline combining Aya-expanse-8B as a Persian-to-English translation model with five open-source small language models (SLMs) -- Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct, and Gemma-3-1B-it -- for binary extraction of 13 clinical features from 1,221 anonymized Persian transcripts collected at a cancer palliative care call center. Using a few-shot prompting strategy without fine-tuning, models were assessed on macro-averaged F1-score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), sensitivity, and specificity to account for class imbalance. Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct achieved the highest overall performance (median macro-F1: 0.899; MCC: 0.797), while Gemma-3-1B-it showed the weakest results. Larger models (7B--8B parameters) consistently outperformed smaller counterparts in sensitivity and MCC. A bilingual analysis of Aya-expanse-8B revealed that translating Persian transcripts to English improved sensitivity, reduced missing outputs, and boosted metrics robust to class imbalance, though at the cost of slightly lower specificity and precision. Feature-level results showed reliable extraction of physiological symptoms across most models, whereas psychological complaints, administrative requests, and complex somatic features remained challenging. These findings establish a practical, privacy-preserving blueprint for deploying open-source SLMs in multilingual clinical NLP settings with limited infrastructure and annotation resources, and highlight the importance of jointly optimizing model scale and input language strategy for sensitive healthcare applications.]]></description>

Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) links language to region level visual perception. Standard benchmarks (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg) have progressed rapidly with multimodal LLMs but remain weak tests of visual reasoning and grounding: (i) many expressions are very short, leaving little reasoning demand; (ii) images often contain few distractors, making the target easy to find; and (iii) redundant descriptors enable shortcut solutions that bypass genuine text understanding and visual reasoning. We introduce Ref-Adv, a modern REC benchmark that suppresses shortcuts by pairing linguistically nontrivial expressions with only the information necessary to uniquely identify the target. The dataset contains referring expressions on real images, curated with hard distractors and annotated with reasoning facets including negation. We conduct comprehensive ablations (word order perturbations and descriptor deletion sufficiency) to show that solving Ref-Adv requires reasoning beyond simple cues, and we evaluate a broad suite of contemporary multimodal LLMs on Ref-Adv. Despite strong results on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, models drop markedly on Ref-Adv, revealing reliance on shortcuts and gaps in visual reasoning and grounding. We provide an in depth failure analysis and aim for Ref-Adv to guide future work on visual reasoning and grounding in MLLMs.]]></description>

Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in high-fidelity image, video, and audio generation, yet inference remains computationally expensive. Nevertheless, current diffusion acceleration methods based on distributed parallelism suffer from noticeable generation artifacts and fail to achieve substantial acceleration proportional to the number of GPUs. Therefore, we propose a hybrid parallelism framework that combines a novel data parallel strategy, condition-based partitioning, with an optimal pipeline scheduling method, adaptive parallelism switching, to reduce generation latency and achieve high generation quality in conditional diffusion models. The key ideas are to (i) leverage the conditional and unconditional denoising paths as a new data-partitioning perspective and (ii) adaptively enable optimal pipeline parallelism according to the denoising discrepancy between these two paths. Our framework achieves 2.31times and 2.07times latency reductions on SDXL and SD3, respectively, using two NVIDIA RTX~3090 GPUs, while preserving image quality. This result confirms the generality of our approach across U-Net-based diffusion models and DiT-based flow-matching architectures. Our approach also outperforms existing methods in acceleration under high-resolution synthesis settings. Code is available at https://github.com/kaist-dmlab/Hybridiff.]]></description>

Recent advances in motion diffusion models have substantially improved the realism of human motion synthesis. However, existing approaches either rely on full-sequence diffusion models with bidirectional generation, which limits temporal causality and real-time applicability, or autoregressive models that suffer from instability and cumulative errors. In this work, we present Causal Motion Diffusion Models (CMDM), a unified framework for autoregressive motion generation based on a causal diffusion transformer that operates in a semantically aligned latent space. CMDM builds upon a Motion-Language-Aligned Causal VAE (MAC-VAE), which encodes motion sequences into temporally causal latent representations. On top of this latent representation, an autoregressive diffusion transformer is trained using causal diffusion forcing to perform temporally ordered denoising across motion frames. To achieve fast inference, we introduce a frame-wise sampling schedule with causal uncertainty, where each subsequent frame is predicted from partially denoised previous frames. The resulting framework supports high-quality text-to-motion generation, streaming synthesis, and long-horizon motion generation at interactive rates. Experiments on HumanML3D and SnapMoGen demonstrate that CMDM outperforms existing diffusion and autoregressive models in both semantic fidelity and temporal smoothness, while substantially reducing inference latency.]]></description>

Recent progress in text-to-image generation has greatly advanced visual fidelity and creativity, but it has also imposed higher demands on prompt complexity-particularly in encoding intricate spatial relationships. In such cases, achieving satisfactory results often requires multiple sampling attempts. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel method that strengthens the spatial understanding of current image generation models. We first construct the SpatialReward-Dataset with over 80k preference pairs. Building on this dataset, we build SpatialScore, a reward model designed to evaluate the accuracy of spatial relationships in text-to-image generation, achieving performance that even surpasses leading proprietary models on spatial evaluation. We further demonstrate that this reward model effectively enables online reinforcement learning for the complex spatial generation. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our specialized reward model yields significant and consistent gains in spatial understanding for image generation.]]></description>

Deep research has emerged as an important task that aims to address hard queries through extensive open-web exploration. To tackle it, most prior work equips large language model (LLM)-based agents with opaque web search APIs, enabling agents to iteratively issue search queries, retrieve external evidence, and reason over it. Despite search's essential role in deep research, black-box web search APIs hinder systematic analysis of search components, leaving the behaviour of established text ranking methods in deep research largely unclear. To fill this gap, we reproduce a selection of key findings and best practices for IR text ranking methods in the deep research setting. In particular, we examine their effectiveness from three perspectives: (i) retrieval units (documents vs. passages), (ii) pipeline configurations (different retrievers, re-rankers, and re-ranking depths), and (iii) query characteristics (the mismatch between agent-issued queries and the training queries of text rankers). We perform experiments on BrowseComp-Plus, a deep research dataset with a fixed corpus, evaluating 2 open-source agents, 5 retrievers, and 3 re-rankers across diverse setups. We find that agent-issued queries typically follow web-search-style syntax (e.g., quoted exact matches), favouring lexical, learned sparse, and multi-vector retrievers; passage-level units are more efficient under limited context windows, and avoid the difficulties of document length normalisation in lexical retrieval; re-ranking is highly effective; translating agent-issued queries into natural-language questions significantly bridges the query mismatch.]]></description>

Advanced reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to more frequent hallucinations; yet most mitigation work focuses on open-source models for post-hoc detection and parameter editing. The dearth of studies focusing on hallucinations in closed-source models is especially concerning, as they constitute the vast majority of models in institutional deployments. We introduce QueryBandits, a model-agnostic contextual bandit framework that adaptively learns online to select the optimal query-rewrite strategy by leveraging an empirically validated and calibrated reward function. Across 16 QA scenarios, our top QueryBandit (Thompson Sampling) achieves an 87.5% win rate over a No-Rewrite baseline and outperforms zero-shot static policies (e.g., Paraphrase or Expand) by 42.6% and 60.3%, respectively. Moreover, all contextual bandits outperform vanilla bandits across all datasets, with higher feature variance coinciding with greater variance in arm selection. This substantiates our finding that there is no single rewrite policy optimal for all queries. We also discover that certain static policies incur higher cumulative regret than No-Rewrite, indicating that an inflexible query-rewriting policy can worsen hallucinations. Thus, learning an online policy over semantic features with QueryBandits can shift model behavior purely through forward-pass mechanisms, enabling its use with closed-source models and bypassing the need for retraining or gradient-based adaptation.]]></description>

Scaling multimodal alignment between video and audio is challenging, particularly due to limited data and the mismatch between text descriptions and frame-level video information. In this work, we tackle the scaling challenge in multimodal-to-audio generation, examining whether models trained on short instances can generalize to longer ones during testing. To tackle this challenge, we present multimodal hierarchical networks so-called MMHNet, an enhanced extension of state-of-the-art video-to-audio models. Our approach integrates a hierarchical method and non-causal Mamba to support long-form audio generation. Our proposed method significantly improves long audio generation up to more than 5 minutes. We also prove that training short and testing long is possible in the video-to-audio generation tasks without training on the longer durations. We show in our experiments that our proposed method could achieve remarkable results on long-video to audio benchmarks, beating prior works in video-to-audio tasks. Moreover, we showcase our model capability in generating more than 5 minutes, while prior video-to-audio methods fall short in generating with long durations.]]></description>

Generating realistic conversational gestures are essential for achieving natural, socially engaging interactions with digital humans. However, existing methods typically map a single audio stream to a single speaker's motion, without considering social context or modeling the mutual dynamics between two people engaging in conversation. We present DyaDiT, a multi-modal diffusion transformer that generates contextually appropriate human motion from dyadic audio signals. Trained on Seamless Interaction Dataset, DyaDiT takes dyadic audio with optional social-context tokens to produce context-appropriate motion. It fuses information from both speakers to capture interaction dynamics, uses a motion dictionary to encode motion priors, and can optionally utilize the conversational partner's gestures to produce more responsive motion. We evaluate DyaDiT on standard motion generation metrics and conduct quantitative user studies, demonstrating that it not only surpasses existing methods on objective metrics but is also strongly preferred by users, highlighting its robustness and socially favorable motion generation. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.]]></description>

Sarcasm detection poses a fundamental challenge in computational semantics, requiring models to resolve disparities between literal and intended meaning. The challenge is amplified in low-resource languages where annotated datasets are scarce or nonexistent. We present Yor-Sarc, the first gold-standard dataset for sarcasm detection in Yorùbá, a tonal Niger-Congo language spoken by over 50 million people. The dataset comprises 436 instances annotated by three native speakers from diverse dialectal backgrounds using an annotation protocol specifically designed for Yorùbá sarcasm by taking culture into account. This protocol incorporates context-sensitive interpretation and community-informed guidelines and is accompanied by a comprehensive analysis of inter-annotator agreement to support replication in other African languages. Substantial to almost perfect agreement was achieved (Fleiss' κ= 0.7660; pairwise Cohen's κ= 0.6732--0.8743), with 83.3% unanimous consensus. One annotator pair achieved almost perfect agreement (κ= 0.8743; 93.8% raw agreement), exceeding a number of reported benchmarks for English sarcasm research works. The remaining 16.7% majority-agreement cases are preserved as soft labels for uncertainty-aware modelling. Yor-Sarchttps://github.com/toheebadura/yor-sarc is expected to facilitate research on semantic interpretation and culturally informed NLP for low-resource African languages.]]></description>

Generative retrieval has emerged as a powerful paradigm for LLM-based recommendation. However, industrial recommender systems often benefit from restricting the output space to a constrained subset of items based on business logic (e.g. enforcing content freshness or product category), which standard autoregressive decoding cannot natively support. Moreover, existing constrained decoding methods that make use of prefix trees (Tries) incur severe latency penalties on hardware accelerators (TPUs/GPUs). In this work, we introduce STATIC (Sparse Transition Matrix-Accelerated Trie Index for Constrained Decoding), an efficient and scalable constrained decoding technique designed specifically for high-throughput LLM-based generative retrieval on TPUs/GPUs. By flattening the prefix tree into a static Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) matrix, we transform irregular tree traversals into fully vectorized sparse matrix operations, unlocking massive efficiency gains on hardware accelerators. We deploy STATIC on a large-scale industrial video recommendation platform serving billions of users. STATIC produces significant product metric impact with minimal latency overhead (0.033 ms per step and 0.25% of inference time), achieving a 948x speedup over a CPU trie implementation and a 47-1033x speedup over a hardware-accelerated binary-search baseline. Furthermore, the runtime overhead of STATIC remains extremely low across a wide range of practical configurations. To the best of our knowledge, STATIC enables the first production-scale deployment of strictly constrained generative retrieval. In addition, evaluation on academic benchmarks demonstrates that STATIC can considerably improve cold-start performance for generative retrieval. Our code is available at https://github.com/youtube/static-constraint-decoding.]]></description>

Latent visual reasoning aims to mimic human's imagination process by meditating through hidden states of Multimodal Large Language Models. While recognized as a promising paradigm for visual reasoning, the underlying mechanisms driving its effectiveness remain unclear. Motivated to demystify the true source of its efficacy, we investigate the validity of latent reasoning using Causal Mediation Analysis. We model the process as a causal chain: the input as the treatment, the latent tokens as the mediator, and the final answer as the outcome. Our findings uncover two critical disconnections: (a) Input-Latent Disconnect: dramatic perturbations on the input result in negligible changes to the latent tokens, suggesting that latent tokens do not effectively attend to the input sequence. (b) Latent-Answer Disconnect: perturbations on the latent tokens yield minimal impact on the final answer, indicating the limited causal effect latent tokens imposing on the outcome. Furthermore, extensive probing analysis reveals that latent tokens encode limited visual information and exhibit high similarity. Consequently, we challenge the necessity of latent reasoning and propose a straightforward alternative named CapImagine, which teaches the model to explicitly imagine using text. Experiments on vision-centric benchmarks show that CapImagine significantly outperforms complex latent-space baselines, highlighting the superior potential of visual reasoning through explicit imagination.]]></description>

Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) Dropout methods address overfitting under sparse-view conditions by randomly nullifying Gaussian opacities. However, we identify a neighbor compensation effect in these approaches: dropped Gaussians are often compensated by their neighbors, weakening the intended regularization. Moreover, these methods overlook the contribution of high-degree spherical harmonic coefficients (SH) to overfitting. To address these issues, we propose DropAnSH-GS, a novel anchor-based Dropout strategy. Rather than dropping Gaussians independently, our method randomly selects certain Gaussians as anchors and simultaneously removes their spatial neighbors. This effectively disrupts local redundancies near anchors and encourages the model to learn more robust, globally informed representations. Furthermore, we extend the Dropout to color attributes by randomly dropping higher-degree SH to concentrate appearance information in lower-degree SH. This strategy further mitigates overfitting and enables flexible post-training model compression via SH truncation. Experimental results demonstrate that DropAnSH-GS substantially outperforms existing Dropout methods with negligible computational overhead, and can be readily integrated into various 3DGS variants to enhance their performances.

We introduce DLT-Corpus, the largest domain-specific text collection for Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) research to date: 2.98 billion tokens from 22.12 million documents spanning scientific literature (37,440 publications), United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) patents (49,023 filings), and social media (22 million posts). Existing Natural Language Processing (NLP) resources for DLT focus narrowly on cryptocurrencies price prediction and smart contracts, leaving domain-specific language under explored despite the sector's ~$3 trillion market capitalization and rapid technological evolution.
  We demonstrate DLT-Corpus' utility by analyzing technology emergence patterns and market-innovation correlations. Findings reveal that technologies originate in scientific literature before reaching patents and social media, following traditional technology transfer patterns. While social media sentiment remains overwhelmingly bullish even during crypto winters, scientific and patent activity grow independently of market fluctuations, tracking overall market expansion in a virtuous cycle where research precedes and enables economic growth that funds further innovation.
  We publicly release the full DLT-Corpus; LedgerBERT, a domain-adapted model achieving 23% improvement over BERT-base on a DLT-specific Named Entity Recognition (NER) task; and all associated tools and code.]]></description>

The analysis of non-stationary time-series data requires insight into its local and global patterns with physical interpretability. However, traditional smoothing algorithms, such as B-splines, Savitzky-Golay filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), lack the ability to perform parametric optimization with guaranteed continuity. In this paper, we propose Functional Continuous Decomposition (FCD), a JAX-accelerated framework that performs parametric, continuous optimization on a wide range of mathematical functions. By using Levenberg-Marquardt optimization to achieve up to C^1 continuous fitting, FCD transforms raw time-series data into M modes that capture different temporal patterns from short-term to long-term trends. Applications of FCD include physics, medicine, financial analysis, and machine learning, where it is commonly used for the analysis of signal temporal patterns, optimized parameters, derivatives, and integrals of decomposition. Furthermore, FCD can be applied for physical analysis and feature extraction with an average SRMSE of 0.735 per segment and a speed of 0.47s on full decomposition of 1,000 points. Finally, we demonstrate that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) enhanced with FCD features, such as optimized function values, parameters, and derivatives, achieved 16.8% faster convergence and 2.5% higher accuracy over a standard CNN.]]></description>

Significant progress has been made in the field of Instruction-based Image Editing Models (IIEMs). However, while these models demonstrate plausible adherence to instructions and strong reasoning ability on current benchmarks, their ability to edit small objects remains underexplored, despite its importance for precise local editing and refining details in both real and generated images. In this paper, we introduce DeepLookEditBench (DLEBench), the first benchmark dedicated to assessing the abilities of IIEMs in editing small-scale objects. Specifically, we construct a challenging testbed comprising 1889 samples across seven instruction types. In these samples, target objects occupy only 1%-10% of the image area, covering complex scenarios such as partial occlusion and multi-object editing. To ensure robust evaluation on this benchmark, we propose an evaluation protocol with refined score rubrics to minimize subjectivity and ambiguity in two criteria: Instruction Following and Visual Consistency. This protocol also introduces a dual-mode evaluation framework (Tool-driven and Oracle-guided Modes) addressing the misalignment between LMM-as-a-Judge and human judgements on DLEBench. Empirical results on 10 IIEMs reveal significant performance gaps in small-scale object editing, highlighting the need for specialized benchmarks to advance this ability.]]></description>

Dense 4D reconstruction from unposed images remains a critical challenge, with current methods relying on slow test-time optimization or fragmented, task-specific feedforward models. We introduce UFO-4D, a unified feedforward framework to reconstruct a dense, explicit 4D representation from just a pair of unposed images. UFO-4D directly estimates dynamic 3D Gaussian Splats, enabling the joint and consistent estimation of 3D geometry, 3D motion, and camera pose in a feedforward manner. Our core insight is that differentiably rendering multiple signals from a single Dynamic 3D Gaussian representation offers major training advantages. This approach enables a self-supervised image synthesis loss while tightly coupling appearance, depth, and motion. Since all modalities share the same geometric primitives, supervising one inherently regularizes and improves the others. This synergy overcomes data scarcity, allowing UFO-4D to outperform prior work by up to 3 times in joint geometry, motion, and camera pose estimation. Our representation also enables high-fidelity 4D interpolation across novel views and time. Please visit our project page for visual results: https://ufo-4d.github.io/]]></description>

Scaling video generation from seconds to minutes faces a critical bottleneck: while short-video data is abundant and high-fidelity, coherent long-form data is scarce and limited to narrow domains. To address this, we propose a training paradigm where Mode Seeking meets Mean Seeking, decoupling local fidelity from long-term coherence based on a unified representation via a Decoupled Diffusion Transformer. Our approach utilizes a global Flow Matching head trained via supervised learning on long videos to capture narrative structure, while simultaneously employing a local Distribution Matching head that aligns sliding windows to a frozen short-video teacher via a mode-seeking reverse-KL divergence. This strategy enables the synthesis of minute-scale videos that learns long-range coherence and motions from limited long videos via supervised flow matching, while inheriting local realism by aligning every sliding-window segment of the student to a frozen short-video teacher, resulting in a few-step fast long video generator. Evaluations show that our method effectively closes the fidelity-horizon gap by jointly improving local sharpness, motion and long-range consistency.

The fast-growing demands in using Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex multi-step data science tasks create an emergent need for accurate benchmarking. There are two major gaps in existing benchmarks: (i) the lack of standardized, process-aware evaluation that captures instruction adherence and process fidelity, and (ii) the scarcity of accurately labeled training data. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DARE-bench, a benchmark designed for machine learning modeling and data science instruction following. Unlike many existing benchmarks that rely on human- or model-based judges, all tasks in DARE-bench have verifiable ground truth, ensuring objective and reproducible evaluation. To cover a broad range of tasks and support agentic tools, DARE-bench consists of 6,300 Kaggle-derived tasks and provides both large-scale training data and evaluation sets. Extensive evaluations show that even highly capable models such as gpt-o4-mini struggle to achieve good performance, especially in machine learning modeling tasks. Using DARE-bench training tasks for fine-tuning can substantially improve model performance. For example, supervised fine-tuning boosts Qwen3-32B's accuracy by 1.83x and reinforcement learning boosts Qwen3-4B's accuracy by more than 8x. These significant improvements verify the importance of DARE-bench both as an accurate evaluation benchmark and critical training data.]]></description>

Multi-turn interactions with large language models typically retain the assistant's own past responses in the conversation history. In this work, we revisit this design choice by asking whether large language models benefit from conditioning on their own prior responses. Using in-the-wild, multi-turn conversations, we compare standard (full-context) prompting with a user-turn-only prompting approach that omits all previous assistant responses, across three open reasoning models and one state-of-the-art model. To our surprise, we find that removing prior assistant responses does not affect response quality on a large fraction of turns. Omitting assistant-side history can reduce cumulative context lengths by up to 10x. To explain this result, we find that multi-turn conversations consist of a substantial proportion (36.4%) of self-contained prompts, and that many follow-up prompts provide sufficient instruction to be answered using only the current user turn and prior user turns. When analyzing cases where user-turn-only prompting substantially outperforms full context, we identify instances of context pollution, in which models over-condition on their previous responses, introducing errors, hallucinations, or stylistic artifacts that propagate across turns. Motivated by these findings, we design a context-filtering approach that selectively omits assistant-side context. Our findings suggest that selectively omitting assistant history can improve response quality while reducing memory consumption.]]></description>

Modern optimizers like Adam and Muon are central to training large language models, but their reliance on first- and second-order momenta introduces significant memory overhead, which constrains scalability and computational efficiency. In this work, we reframe the exponential moving average (EMA) used in these momenta as the training of a linear regressor via online gradient flow. Building on this equivalence, we introduce LoRA-Pre, a novel low-rank optimizer designed for efficient pre-training. Specifically, LoRA-Pre reduces the optimizer's memory footprint by decomposing the full momentum matrix into a compact low-rank subspace within the online linear learner, thereby maintaining optimization performance while improving memory efficiency. We empirically validate LoRA-Pre's efficacy by pre-training models from the Llama architecture family, scaling from 60M to 1B parameters. LoRA-Pre achieves the highest performance across all model sizes. Notably, LoRA-Pre demonstrates remarkable rank efficiency, achieving comparable or superior results using only 1/8 the rank of baseline methods. Beyond pre-training, we evaluate LoRA-Pre's effectiveness in fine-tuning scenarios. With the same rank, LoRA-Pre consistently outperforms all efficient fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, compared to standard LoRA, LoRA-Pre achieves substantial improvements of 3.14 points on Llama-3.1-8B and 6.17 points on Llama-2-7B, validating our approach's effectiveness across both pre-training and fine-tuning paradigms. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/mrflogs/LoRA-Pre.]]></description>

Identifiability in representation learning is commonly evaluated using standard metrics (e.g., MCC, DCI, R^2) on synthetic benchmarks with known ground-truth factors. These metrics are assumed to reflect recovery up to the equivalence class guaranteed by identifiability theory. We show that this assumption holds only under specific structural conditions: each metric implicitly encodes assumptions about both the data-generating process (DGP) and the encoder. When these assumptions are violated, metrics become misspecified and can produce systematic false positives and false negatives. Such failures occur both within classical identifiability regimes and in post-hoc settings where identifiability is most needed. We introduce a taxonomy separating DGP assumptions from encoder geometry, use it to characterise the validity domains of existing metrics, and release an evaluation suite for reproducible stress testing and comparison.]]></description>

Many readers today struggle to assess the trustworthiness of online news because reliable reporting coexists with misinformation. The TREC 2025 DRAGUN (Detection, Retrieval, and Augmented Generation for Understanding News) Track provided a venue for researchers to develop and evaluate assistive RAG systems that support readers' news trustworthiness assessment by producing reader-oriented, well-attributed reports. As the organizers of the DRAGUN track, we describe the resources that we have newly developed to allow for the reuse of the track's tasks. The track had two tasks: (Task 1) Question Generation, producing 10 ranked investigative questions; and (Task 2, the main task) Report Generation, producing a 250-word report grounded in the MS MARCO V2.1 Segmented Corpus. As part of the track's evaluation, we had TREC assessors create importance-weighted rubrics of questions with expected short answers for 30 different news articles. These rubrics represent the information that assessors believe is important for readers to assess an article's trustworthiness. The assessors then used their rubrics to manually judge the participating teams' submitted runs. To make these tasks and their rubrics reusable, we have created an automated process to judge runs not part of the original assessing. We show that our AutoJudge ranks existing runs well compared to the TREC human-assessed evaluation (Kendall's $τ= 0.678$ for Task 1 and $τ= 0.872$ for Task 2). These resources enable both the evaluation of RAG systems for assistive news trustworthiness assessment and, with the human evaluation as a benchmark, research on improving automated RAG evaluation.]]></description>

Humans perceive actions through key transitions that structure actions across multiple abstraction levels, whereas machines, relying on visual features, tend to over-segment. This highlights the difficulty of enabling hierarchical reasoning in video understanding. Interestingly, we observe that lower-level visual and high-level action latent variables evolve at different rates, with low-level visual variables changing rapidly, while high-level action variables evolve more slowly, making them easier to identify. Building on this insight, we propose the Hierarchical Action Learning (\textbf{HAL}) model for weakly-supervised action segmentation. Our approach introduces a hierarchical causal data generation process, where high-level latent action governs the dynamics of low-level visual features. To model these varying timescales effectively, we introduce deterministic processes to align these latent variables over time. The \textbf{HAL} model employs a hierarchical pyramid transformer to capture both visual features and latent variables, and a sparse transition constraint is applied to enforce the slower dynamics of high-level action variables. This mechanism enhances the identification of these latent variables over time. Under mild assumptions, we prove that these latent action variables are strictly identifiable. Experimental results on several benchmarks show that the \textbf{HAL} model significantly outperforms existing methods for weakly-supervised action segmentation, confirming its practical effectiveness in real-world applications.]]></description>

We propose a minimal agentic baseline that enables systematic comparison across different AI-based theorem prover architectures. This design implements the core features shared among state-of-the-art systems: iterative proof refinement, library search and context management. We evaluate our baseline using qualitatively different benchmarks and compare various popular models and design choices, and demonstrate competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while using a significantly simpler architecture. Our results demonstrate consistent advantages of an iterative approach over multiple single-shot generations, especially in terms of sample efficiency and cost effectiveness. The implementation is released open-source as a candidate reference for future research and as an accessible prover for the community.]]></description>

Neural networks are hypothesized to implement interpretable causal mechanisms, yet verifying this requires finding a causal abstraction -- a simpler, high-level Structural Causal Model (SCM) faithful to the network under interventions. Discovering such abstractions is hard: it typically demands brute-force interchange interventions or retraining. We reframe the problem by viewing structured pruning as a search over approximate abstractions. Treating a trained network as a deterministic SCM, we derive an Interventional Risk objective whose second-order expansion yields closed-form criteria for replacing units with constants or folding them into neighbors. Under uniform curvature, our score reduces to activation variance, recovering variance-based pruning as a special case while clarifying when it fails. The resulting procedure efficiently extracts sparse, intervention-faithful abstractions from pretrained networks, which we validate via interchange interventions.]]></description>

Compositional generalization, the ability to recognize familiar parts in novel contexts, is a defining property of intelligent systems. Although modern models are trained on massive datasets, they still cover only a tiny fraction of the combinatorial space of possible inputs, raising the question of what structure representations must have to support generalization to unseen combinations. We formalize three desiderata for compositional generalization under standard training (divisibility, transferability, stability) and show they impose necessary geometric constraints: representations must decompose linearly into per-concept components, and these components must be orthogonal across concepts. This provides theoretical grounding for the Linear Representation Hypothesis: the linear structure widely observed in neural representations is a necessary consequence of compositional generalization. We further derive dimension bounds linking the number of composable concepts to the embedding geometry. Empirically, we evaluate these predictions across modern vision models (CLIP, SigLIP, DINO) and find that representations exhibit partial linear factorization with low-rank, near-orthogonal per-concept factors, and that the degree of this structure correlates with compositional generalization on unseen combinations. As models continue to scale, these conditions predict the representational geometry they may converge to. Code is available at https://github.com/oshapio/necessary-compositionality.]]></description>

In this article, bipartite ranking, a statistical learning problem involved in many applications and widely studied in the passive context, is approached in a much more general \textit{active setting} than the discrete one previously considered in the literature. While the latter assumes that the conditional distribution is piece wise constant, the framework we develop permits in contrast to deal with continuous conditional distributions, provided that they fulfill a Hölder smoothness constraint. We first show that a naive approach based on discretisation at a uniform level, fixed \textit{a priori} and consisting in applying next the active strategy designed for the discrete setting generally fails. Instead, we propose a novel algorithm, referred to as smooth-rank and designed for the continuous setting, which aims to minimise the distance between the ROC curve of the estimated ranking rule and the optimal one w.r.t. the $\sup$ norm. We show that, for a fixed confidence level $ε>0$ and probability $δ\in (0,1)$, smooth-rank is PAC$(ε,δ)$. In addition, we provide a problem dependent upper bound on the expected sampling time of smooth-rank and establish a problem dependent lower bound on the expected sampling time of any PAC$(ε,δ)$ algorithm. Beyond the theoretical analysis carried out, numerical results are presented, providing solid empirical evidence of the performance of the algorithm proposed, which compares favorably with alternative approaches.]]></description>

Identifying the full landscape of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in specialized industry sectors is critical for supply-chain resilience, yet existing business databases suffer from substantial coverage gaps -- particularly for sub-tier suppliers and firms in emerging niche markets. We propose a \textbf{Web--Knowledge--Web (W$\to$K$\to$W)} pipeline that iteratively (1)~crawls domain-specific web sources to discover candidate supplier entities, (2)~extracts and consolidates structured knowledge into a heterogeneous knowledge graph, and (3)~uses the knowledge graph's topology and coverage signals to guide subsequent crawling toward under-represented regions of the supplier space. To quantify discovery completeness, we introduce a \textbf{coverage estimation framework} inspired by ecological species-richness estimators (Chao1, ACE) adapted for web-entity populations. Experiments on the semiconductor equipment manufacturing sector (NAICS 333242) demonstrate that the W$\to$K$\to$W pipeline achieves the highest precision (0.138) and F1 (0.118) among all methods using the same 213-page crawl budget, building a knowledge graph of 765 entities and 586 relations while reaching peak recall by iteration~3 with only 112 pages.]]></description>

Accurate fault detection and localization in electrical distribution systems is crucial, especially with the increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs), which inject greater variability and complexity into grid operations. In this study, FaultXformer is proposed, a Transformer encoder-based architecture developed for automatic fault analysis using real-time current data obtained from phasor measurement unit (PMU). The approach utilizes time-series current data to initially extract rich temporal information in stage 1, which is crucial for identifying the fault type and precisely determining its location across multiple nodes. In Stage 2, these extracted features are processed to differentiate among distinct fault types and identify the respective fault location within the distribution system. Thus, this dual-stage transformer encoder pipeline enables high-fidelity representation learning, considerably boosting the performance of the work. The model was validated on a dataset generated from the IEEE 13-node test feeder, simulated with 20 separate fault locations and several DER integration scenarios, utilizing current measurements from four strategically located PMUs. To demonstrate robust performance evaluation, stratified 10-fold cross-validation is performed. FaultXformer achieved average accuracies of 98.76% in fault type classification and 98.92% in fault location identification across cross-validation, consistently surpassing conventional deep learning baselines convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN). long short-term memory (LSTM) by 1.70%, 34.95%, and 2.04% in classification accuracy and by 10.82%, 40.89%, and 6.27% in location accuracy, respectively. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model with significant DER penetration.]]></description>

Batch effects arising from technical variations in histopathology staining protocols, scanners, and acquisition pipelines pose a persistent challenge for computational pathology, hindering cross-batch generalization and limiting reliable deployment of models across clinical sites. In this work, we introduce Latent Manifold Compaction (LMC), an unsupervised representation learning framework that performs image harmonization by learning batch-invariant embeddings from a single source dataset through explicit compaction of stain-induced latent manifolds. This allows LMC to generalize to target domain data unseen during training. Evaluated on three challenging public and in-house benchmarks, LMC substantially reduces batch-induced separations across multiple datasets and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art normalization methods in downstream cross-batch classification and detection tasks, enabling superior generalization.]]></description>

We propose Chunk-wise Attention Transducer (CHAT), a novel extension to RNN-T models that processes audio in fixed-size chunks while employing cross-attention within each chunk. This hybrid approach maintains RNN-T's streaming capability while introducing controlled flexibility for local alignment modeling. CHAT significantly reduces the temporal dimension that RNN-T must handle, yielding substantial efficiency improvements: up to 46.2% reduction in peak training memory, up to 1.36X faster training, and up to 1.69X faster inference. Alongside these efficiency gains, CHAT achieves consistent accuracy improvements over RNN-T across multiple languages and tasks -- up to 6.3% relative WER reduction for speech recognition and up to 18.0% BLEU improvement for speech translation. The method proves particularly effective for speech translation, where RNN-T's strict monotonic alignment hurts performance. Our results demonstrate that the CHAT model offers a practical solution for deploying more capable streaming speech models without sacrificing real-time constraints.]]></description>

Diffusion-based Real-World Image Super-Resolution (Real-ISR) achieves impressive perceptual quality but suffers from high computational costs due to iterative sampling. While recent distillation approaches leveraging large-scale Text-to-Image (T2I) priors have enabled one-step generation, they are typically hindered by prohibitive parameter counts and the inherent capability bounds imposed by teacher models. As a lightweight alternative, Consistency Models offer efficient inference but struggle with two critical limitations: the accumulation of consistency drift inherent to transitive training, and a phenomenon we term "Geometric Decoupling" - where the generative trajectory achieves pixel-wise alignment yet fails to preserve structural coherence. To address these challenges, we propose GTASR (Geometric Trajectory Alignment Super-Resolution), a simple yet effective consistency training paradigm for Real-ISR. Specifically, we introduce a Trajectory Alignment (TA) strategy to rectify the tangent vector field via full-path projection, and a Dual-Reference Structural Rectification (DRSR) mechanism to enforce strict structural constraints. Extensive experiments verify that GTASR delivers superior performance over representative baselines while maintaining minimal latency. The code and model will be released at https://github.com/Blazedengcy/GTASR.]]></description>

Accurate forecasting of transportation dynamics is essential for urban mobility and infrastructure planning. Although recent work has achieved strong performance with deep learning models, these methods typically require dataset-specific training, architecture design and hyper-parameter tuning. This paper evaluates whether general-purpose time-series foundation models can serve as forecasters for transportation tasks by benchmarking the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art model, Chronos-2, across ten real-world datasets covering highway traffic volume and flow, urban traffic speed, bike-sharing demand, and electric vehicle charging station data. Under a consistent evaluation protocol, we find that, even without any task-specific fine-tuning, Chronos-2 delivers state-of-the-art or competitive accuracy across most datasets, frequently outperforming classical statistical baselines and specialized deep learning architectures, particularly at longer horizons. Beyond point forecasting, we evaluate its native probabilistic outputs using prediction-interval coverage and sharpness, demonstrating that Chronos-2 also provides useful uncertainty quantification without dataset-specific training. In general, this study supports the adoption of time-series foundation models as a key baseline for transportation forecasting research.]]></description>

Safety-critical task planning in robotic systems remains challenging: classical planners suffer from poor scalability, Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based methods generalize poorly, and base Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot guarantee safety. To address this gap, we propose safety-generalizable large language models, named SafeGen-LLM. SafeGen-LLM can not only enhance the safety satisfaction of task plans but also generalize well to novel safety properties in various domains. We first construct a multi-domain Planning Domain Definition Language 3 (PDDL3) benchmark with explicit safety constraints. Then, we introduce a two-stage post-training framework: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on a constraint-compliant planning dataset to learn planning syntax and semantics, and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by fine-grained reward machines derived from formal verification to enforce safety alignment and by curriculum learning to better handle complex tasks. Extensive experiments show that SafeGen-LLM achieves strong safety generalization and outperforms frontier proprietary baselines across multi-domain planning tasks and multiple input formats (e.g., PDDLs and natural language).]]></description>

We present improved learning-augmented algorithms for finding an approximate minimum spanning tree (MST) for points in an arbitrary metric space. Our work follows a recent framework called metric forest completion (MFC), where the learned input is a forest that must be given additional edges to form a full spanning tree. Veldt et al. (2025) showed that optimally completing the forest takes $Ω(n^2)$ time, but designed a 2.62-approximation for MFC with subquadratic complexity. The same method is a $(2γ+ 1)$-approximation for the original MST problem, where $γ\geq 1$ is a quality parameter for the initial forest. We introduce a generalized method that interpolates between this prior algorithm and an optimal $Ω(n^2)$-time MFC algorithm. Our approach considers only edges incident to a growing number of strategically chosen ``representative'' points. One corollary of our analysis is to improve the approximation factor of the previous algorithm from 2.62 for MFC and $(2γ+1)$ for metric MST to 2 and $2γ$ respectively. We prove this is tight for worst-case instances, but we still obtain better instance-specific approximations using our generalized method. We complement our theoretical results with a thorough experimental evaluation.]]></description>

In this paper, we provide the first investigation into adaptive combinatorial experimental design, focusing on the trade-off between regret minimization and statistical power in combinatorial multi-armed bandits (CMAB). While minimizing regret requires repeated exploitation of high-reward arms, accurate inference on reward gaps requires sufficient exploration of suboptimal actions. We formalize this trade-off through the concept of Pareto optimality and establish equivalent conditions for Pareto-efficient learning in CMAB. We consider two relevant cases under different information structures, i.e., full-bandit feedback and semi-bandit feedback, and propose two algorithms MixCombKL and MixCombUCB respectively for these two cases. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that both algorithms are Pareto optimal, achieving finite-time guarantees on both regret and estimation error of arm gaps. Our results further reveal that richer feedback significantly tightens the attainable Pareto frontier, with the primary gains arising from improved estimation accuracy under our proposed methods. Taken together, these findings establish a principled framework for adaptive combinatorial experimentation in multi-objective decision-making.]]></description>

Calibration$\unicode{x2014}$the problem of ensuring that predicted probabilities align with observed class frequencies$\unicode{x2014}$is a basic desideratum for reliable prediction with machine learning systems. Calibration error is traditionally assessed via a divergence function, using the expected divergence between predictions and empirical frequencies. Accurately estimating this quantity is challenging, especially in the multiclass setting. Here, we show how to extend a recent variational framework for estimating calibration errors beyond divergences induced induced by proper losses, to cover a broad class of calibration errors induced by $L_p$ divergences. Our method can separate over- and under-confidence and, unlike non-variational approaches, avoids overestimation. We provide extensive experiments and integrate our code in the open-source package probmetrics (https://github.com/dholzmueller/probmetrics) for evaluating calibration errors.]]></description>

Reconstructing fluid flows from sparse sensor measurements is a fundamental challenge in science and engineering. Widely separated measurements and complex, multiscale dynamics make accurate recovery of fine-scale structures difficult. In addition, existing methods face a persistent tradeoff: high-accuracy models are often computationally expensive, whereas faster approaches typically compromise fidelity. In this work, we introduce BLISSNet, a model that strikes a strong balance between reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency for both flow reconstruction and nudging-based data assimilation. The model follows a DeepONet-like architecture, enabling zero-shot inference on domains of arbitrary size. After the first model call on a given domain, certain network components can be precomputed, leading to low inference cost for subsequent evaluations on large domains. Consequently, the model can achieve faster inference than classical interpolation methods such as radial basis function or bicubic interpolation. This combination of high accuracy, low cost, and zero-shot generalization makes BLISSNet well-suited for large-scale real-time flow reconstruction and data assimilation tasks.]]></description>

Modern microscopy routinely produces gigapixel images that contain structures across multiple spatial scales, from fine cellular morphology to broader tissue organization. Many analysis tasks require combining these scales, yet most vision models operate at a single resolution or derive multi-scale features from one view, limiting their ability to exploit the inherently multi-resolution nature of microscopy data. We introduce MuViT, a transformer architecture built to fuse true multi-resolution observations from the same underlying image. MuViT embeds all patches into a shared world-coordinate system and extends rotary positional embeddings to these coordinates, enabling attention to integrate wide-field context with high-resolution detail within a single encoder. Across synthetic benchmarks, kidney histopathology, and high-resolution mouse-brain microscopy, MuViT delivers consistent improvements over strong ViT and CNN baselines. Multi-resolution MAE pretraining further produces scale-consistent representations that enhance downstream tasks. These results demonstrate that explicit world-coordinate modelling provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for leveraging multi-resolution information in large-scale microscopy analysis.]]></description>

Quantum machine learning applies principles such as superposition and entanglement to data processing and optimization. Variational quantum models operate on qubits in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces and provide an alternative approach to model expressivity. We compare classical models and a variational quantum classifier on the XOR problem. Logistic regression, a one-hidden-layer multilayer perceptron, and a two-qubit variational quantum classifier with circuit depths 1 and 2 are evaluated on synthetic XOR datasets with varying Gaussian noise and sample sizes using accuracy and binary cross-entropy.
  Performance is determined primarily by model expressivity. Logistic regression and the depth-1 quantum circuit fail to represent XOR reliably, whereas the multilayer perceptron and the depth-2 quantum circuit achieve perfect test accuracy under representative conditions. Robustness analyses across noise levels, dataset sizes, and random seeds confirm that circuit depth is decisive for quantum performance on this task. Despite matching accuracy, the multilayer perceptron achieves lower binary cross-entropy and substantially shorter training time. Hardware execution preserves the global XOR structure but introduces structured deviations in the decision function. Overall, deeper variational quantum classifiers can match classical neural networks in accuracy on low-dimensional XOR benchmarks, but no clear empirical advantage in robustness or efficiency is observed in the examined settings.]]></description>

AI agents powered by reasoning models require access to sensitive user data. However, their reasoning traces are difficult to control, which can result in the unintended leakage of private information to external parties. We propose training models to follow instructions not only in the final answer, but also in reasoning traces, potentially under different constraints. We hypothesize that improving their instruction following abilities in the reasoning traces can improve their privacy-preservation skills. To demonstrate this, we fine-tune models on a new instruction-following dataset with explicit restrictions on reasoning traces. We further introduce a generation strategy that decouples reasoning and answer generation using separate LoRA adapters. We evaluate our approach on six models from two model families, ranging from 1.7B to 14B parameters, across two instruction-following benchmarks and two privacy benchmarks. Our method yields substantial improvements, achieving gains of up to 20.9 points in instruction-following performance and up to 51.9 percentage points on privacy benchmarks. These improvements, however, can come at the cost of task utility, due to the trade-off between reasoning performance and instruction-following abilities. Overall, our results show that improving instruction-following behavior in reasoning models can significantly enhance privacy, suggesting a promising direction for the development of future privacy-aware agents.

Federated learning (FL) is an effective paradigm for distributed environments such as the Internet of Things (IoT), where data from diverse devices with varying functionalities remains localized while contributing to a shared global model. By eliminating the need to transmit raw data, FL inherently preserves privacy. However, the heterogeneous nature of IoT data, stemming from differences in device capabilities, data formats, and communication constraints, poses significant challenges to maintaining both global model performance and privacy. In the context of IoT-based anomaly detection, unsupervised FL offers a promising means to identify abnormal behavior without centralized data aggregation. Nevertheless, feature heterogeneity across devices complicates model training and optimization, hindering effective implementation. In this study we propose an efficient unsupervised FL framework that enhances anomaly detection by leveraging shared features from two distinct IoT datasets: one focused on anomaly detection and the other on device identification, while preserving dataset-specific features. To improve transparency and interpretability, we employ explainable AI techniques, such as SHAP, to identify key features influencing local model decisions. Experiments conducted on real-world IoT datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional FL approaches in anomaly detection accuracy. This work underscores the potential of using shared features from complementary datasets to optimize unsupervised federated learning and achieve superior anomaly detection results in decentralized IoT environments.]]></description>

The use of algorithmic predictions in decision-making leads to a feedback loop where the models we deploy actively influence the data distributions we see, and later use to retrain on. This dynamic was formalized by Perdomo et al. 2020 in their work on performative prediction. Our main result is an unconditional reduction showing that any no-regret algorithm deployed in performative settings converges to a (mixed) performatively stable equilibrium: a solution in which models actively shape data distributions in ways that their own predictions look optimal in hindsight. Prior to our work, all positive results in this area made strong restrictions on how models influenced distributions. By using a martingale argument and allowing randomization, we avoid any such assumption and sidestep recent hardness results for finding stable models. Lastly, on a more conceptual note, our connection sheds light on why common algorithms, like gradient descent, are naturally stabilizing and prevent runaway feedback loops. We hope our work enables future technical transfer of ideas between online optimization and performativity.]]></description>

Estimating density ratios between pairs of intractable data distributions is a core problem in probabilistic modeling, enabling principled comparisons of sample likelihoods under different data-generating processes across conditions and covariates. While exact-likelihood models such as normalizing flows offer a promising approach to density ratio estimation, naive flow-based evaluations are computationally expensive, as they require simulating costly likelihood integrals for each distribution separately. In this work, we leverage condition-aware flow matching to derive a single dynamical formulation for tracking density ratios along generative trajectories. We demonstrate competitive performance on simulated benchmarks for closed-form ratio estimation, and show that our method supports versatile tasks in single-cell genomics data analysis, where likelihood-based comparisons of cellular states across experimental conditions enable treatment effect estimation and batch correction evaluation.]]></description>

Despite their capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) may produce plausible but erroneous outputs, hindering reliable deployment. Accurate uncertainty metrics could enable escalation of unreliable queries to human experts or larger models for improved performance. However, existing uncertainty metrics have practical constraints, such as being designed only for specific modalities, reliant on external tools, or computationally expensive. We introduce UMPIRE, a training-free uncertainty quantification framework for MLLMs that works efficiently across various input and output modalities without external tools, relying only on the models' own internal modality features. UMPIRE computes the incoherence-adjusted semantic volume of sampled MLLM responses for a given task instance, effectively capturing both the global semantic diversity of samples and the local incoherence of responses based on internal model confidence. We propose uncertainty desiderata for MLLMs and provide theoretical analysis motivating UMPIRE's design. Extensive experiments show that UMPIRE consistently outperforms baseline metrics in error detection and uncertainty calibration across image, audio, and video-text benchmarks, including adversarial and out-of-distribution settings. We also demonstrate UMPIRE's generalization to non-text output tasks, including image and audio generation.]]></description>

We study the problem of resilient strategies in the presence of uncertainty. Resilient strategies enable an agent to make decisions that are robust against disturbances. In particular, we are interested in those disturbances that are able to flip a decision made by the agent. Such a disturbance may, for instance, occur when the intended action of the agent cannot be executed due to a malfunction of an actuator in the environment. In this work, we introduce the concept of resilience in the stochastic setting and present a comprehensive set of fundamental problems. Specifically, we discuss such problems for Markov decision processes with reachability and safety objectives, which also smoothly extend to stochastic games. To account for the stochastic setting, we provide various ways of aggregating the amounts of disturbances that may have occurred, for instance, in expectation or in the worst case. Moreover, to reason about infinite disturbances, we use quantitative measures, like their frequency of occurrence.]]></description>

We present a scalable methodology for evaluating language models in multi-turn interactions, using a suite of collaborative games that require effective communication about private information. This enables an interactive scaling analysis, in which a fixed token budget is divided over a variable number of turns. We find that in many cases, language models are unable to use interactive collaboration to improve over the non-interactive baseline scenario in which one agent attempts to summarize its information and the other agent immediately acts -- despite substantial headroom. This suggests that state-of-the-art models still suffer from significant weaknesses in planning and executing multi-turn collaborative conversations. We analyze the linguistic features of these dialogues, assessing the roles of sycophancy, information density, and discourse coherence. While there is no single linguistic explanation for the collaborative weaknesses of contemporary language models, we note that humans achieve comparable task success at superior token efficiency by producing dialogues that are more coherent than those produced by most language models. The proactive management of private information is a defining feature of real-world communication, and we hope that MT-PingEval will drive further work towards improving this capability.]]></description>

Despite advances in machine learning-based medical image classifiers, the safety and reliability of these systems remain major concerns in practical settings. Existing auditing approaches mainly rely on unimodal features or metadata-based subgroup analyses, which are limited in interpretability and often fail to capture hidden systematic failures. To address these limitations, we introduce the first automated auditing framework that extends slice discovery methods to multimodal representations specifically for medical applications. Comprehensive experiments were conducted under common failure scenarios using the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset, demonstrating the framework's strong capability in both failure discovery and explanation generation. Our results also show that multimodal information generally allows more comprehensive and effective auditing of classifiers, while unimodal variants beyond image-only inputs exhibit strong potential in scenarios where resources are constrained.]]></description>

Optimizing the consolidation process in container-based fulfillment centers requires trading off competing objectives such as processing speed, resource usage, and space utilization while adhering to a range of real-world operational constraints. This process involves moving items between containers via a combination of human and robotic workstations to free up space for inbound inventory and increase container utilization. We formulate this problem as a large-scale Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) task with high-dimensional state spaces and dynamic system behavior. Our method builds on recent theoretical advances in solving constrained RL problems via best-response and no-regret dynamics in zero-sum games, enabling principled minimax policy learning. Policy evaluation on realistic warehouse simulations shows that our approach effectively trades off objectives, and we empirically observe that it learns a single policy that simultaneously satisfies all constraints, even if this is not theoretically guaranteed. We further introduce a theoretical framework to handle the problem of error cancellation, where time-averaged solutions display oscillatory behavior. This method returns a single iterate whose Lagrangian value is close to the minimax value of the game. These results demonstrate the promise of MORL in solving complex, high-impact decision-making problems in large-scale industrial systems.]]></description>

Pre-trained vision encoders like DINOv2 have demonstrated exceptional performance on unimodal tasks. However, we observe that their feature representations are poorly aligned across different modalities. For instance, the feature embedding for an RGB image and its corresponding depth map of the same scene exhibit a cosine similarity that is nearly identical to that of two random, unrelated images. To address this, we propose the Omnivorous Vision Encoder, a novel framework that learns a modality-agnostic feature space. We train the encoder with a dual objective: first, to maximize the feature alignment between different modalities of the same scene; and second, a distillation objective that anchors the learned representations to the output of a fully frozen teacher such as DINOv2. The resulting student encoder becomes "omnivorous" by producing a consistent, powerful embedding for a given scene, regardless of the input modality (RGB, Depth, Segmentation, etc.). This approach enables robust cross-modal understanding while retaining the discriminative semantics of the original foundation model.]]></description>

The Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) originates from real production lines, while some practical constraints are often ignored or idealized in current FJSP studies, among which the limited buffer problem has a particular impact on production efficiency. To this end, we study an extended problem that is closer to practical scenarios--the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem with Limited Buffers and Material Kitting. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated considerable potential in scheduling tasks. However, its capacity for state modeling remains limited when handling complex dependencies and long-term constraints. To address this, we leverage a heterogeneous graph network within the DRL framework to model the global state. By constructing efficient message passing among machines, operations, and buffers, the network focuses on avoiding decisions that may cause frequent pallet changes during long-sequence scheduling, thereby helping improve buffer utilization and overall decision quality. Experimental results on both synthetic and real production line datasets show that the proposed method outperforms traditional heuristics and advanced DRL methods in terms of makespan and pallet changes, and also achieves a good balance between solution quality and computational cost. Furthermore, a supplementary video is provided to showcase a simulation system that effectively visualizes the progression of the production line.]]></description>

Recent work has shown the surprising power of low-degree sandwiching polynomial approximators in the context of challenging learning settings such as learning with distribution shift, testable learning, and learning with contamination. A pair of sandwiching polynomials approximate a target function in expectation while also providing pointwise upper and lower bounds on the function's values. In this paper, we give a new method for constructing low-degree sandwiching polynomials that yield greatly improved degree bounds for several fundamental function classes and marginal distributions. In particular, we obtain degree $\mathrm{poly}(k)$ sandwiching polynomials for functions of $k$ halfspaces under the Gaussian distribution, improving exponentially over the prior $2^{O(k)}$ bound. More broadly, our approach applies to function classes that are low-dimensional and have smooth boundary.
  In contrast to prior work, our proof is relatively simple and directly uses the smoothness of the target function's boundary to construct sandwiching Lipschitz functions, which are amenable to results from high-dimensional approximation theory. For low-dimensional polynomial threshold functions (PTFs) with respect to Gaussians, we obtain doubly exponential improvements without applying the FT-mollification method of Kane used in the best previous result.]]></description>

Small language models (SLMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to large language models for task-specific applications. However, they are often employed in high-volume, low-latency settings, where efficiency is crucial. We propose TASC, Task-Adaptive Sequence Compression, a framework for SLM acceleration comprising two use-cases: When performing SLM fine-tuning, we propose TASC-ft, which iteratively enriches the tokenizer vocabulary with high-frequency output n-grams and then fine-tunes the model to utilize the expanded vocabulary. Next, we propose an inference-time method, termed TASC-spec. TASC-spec is a lightweight, training-free speculative decoding method that constructs an n-gram draft model from the task's output corpus, mixing task and context n-gram information.TASC-spec avoids any additional training, while bypassing draft-target vocabulary alignment constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both methods across multiple low output-variability generation tasks. Our methods show consistent improvements in inference efficiency while maintaining task performance.]]></description>

We present a new approach for benchmarking Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities on research-level mathematics. Existing benchmarks largely rely on static, hand-curated sets of contest or textbook-style problems as proxies for mathematical research. Instead, we establish an updatable benchmark evaluating models directly on the latest research results in mathematics. This consists of an automatic pipeline that extracts lemmas from arXiv and rewrites them into self-contained statements by making all assumptions and required definitions explicit. It results in a benchmark that can be updated regularly with new problems taken directly from human mathematical research, while previous instances can be used for training without compromising future evaluations. We benchmark current state-of-the-art LLMs, which obtain around 10-15$\%$ accuracy in theorem proving (pass@1) depending on the model, showing that there is currently a large margin of progression for LLMs to reach human-level proving capabilities in a research context.]]></description>

Argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs) are an existing approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and computational argumentation for decision-making, with the aim of making the resulting decisions faithfully explainable to and contestable by humans. Here we propose a web-based system implementing ArgLLM-empowered agents for binary tasks. ArgLLM-App supports visualisation of the produced explanations and interaction with human users, allowing them to identify and contest any mistakes in the system's reasoning. It is highly modular and enables drawing information from trusted external sources.

Hypothesis testing in singular statistical models is often regarded as inherently problematic due to non-identifiability and degeneracy of the Fisher information. We show that the fundamental obstruction to testing in such models is not singularity itself, but the formulation of hypotheses on non-identifiable parameter quantities. Testing is inherently a problem in distribution space: if two hypotheses induce overlapping subsets of the model class, then no uniformly consistent test exists. We formalize this overlap obstruction and show that hypotheses depending on non-identifiable parameter functions necessarily fail in this sense. In contrast, hypotheses formulated over identifiable observables-quantities that are determined by the induced distribution-reduce entirely to classical testing theory. When the corresponding distributional regimes are separated in Hellinger distance, uniformly consistent tests exist and posterior contraction follows from standard testing-based arguments. Near singular boundaries, separation may collapse locally, leading to scale-dependent detectability governed jointly by sample size and distance to the singular stratum. We illustrate these phenomena in Gaussian mixture models and reduced-rank regression, exhibiting both untestable non-identifiable hypotheses and classically testable identifiable ones. The results provide a structural classification of which hypotheses in singular models are statistically meaningful.]]></description>

Reconstructing photorealistic and animatable 4D head avatars from a single portrait image remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. While diffusion models have enabled remarkable progress in image and video generation for avatar reconstruction, existing methods primarily rely on 2D priors and struggle to achieve consistent 3D geometry. We propose a novel framework that leverages geometry-aware diffusion to learn strong geometry priors for high-fidelity head avatar reconstruction. Our approach jointly synthesizes portrait images and corresponding surface normals, while a pose-free expression encoder captures implicit expression representations. Both synthesized images and expression latents are incorporated into 3D Gaussian-based avatars, enabling photorealistic rendering with accurate geometry. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality, expression fidelity, and cross-identity generalization, while supporting real-time rendering.]]></description>

High-dimensional images, or images with a high-dimensional attribute vector per pixel, are commonly explored with coordinated views of a low-dimensional embedding of the attribute space and a conventional image representation. Nowadays, such images can easily contain several million pixels. For such large datasets, hierarchical embedding techniques are better suited to represent the high-dimensional attribute space than flat dimensionality reduction methods. However, available hierarchical dimensionality reduction methods construct the hierarchy purely based on the attribute information and ignore the spatial layout of pixels in the images. This impedes the exploration of regions of interest in the image space, since there is no congruence between a region of interest in image space and the associated attribute abstractions in the hierarchy. In this paper, we present a superpixel hierarchy for high-dimensional images that takes the high-dimensional attribute manifold into account during construction. Through this, our method enables consistent exploration of high-dimensional images in both image and attribute space. We show the effectiveness of this new image-guided hierarchy in the context of embedding exploration by comparing it with classical hierarchical embedding-based image exploration in two use cases.]]></description>

Vision transformers have recently made a breakthrough in computer vision showing excellent performance in terms of precision for numerous applications. However, their computational cost is very high compared to alternative approaches such as Convolutional Neural Networks. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework for image classification called RAViT based on a multi-branch network that operates on several copies of the same image with different resolutions to reduce the computational cost while preserving the overall accuracy. Furthermore, our framework includes an early exit mechanism that makes our model adaptive and allows to choose the appropriate trade-off between accuracy and computational cost at run-time. For example in a two-branch architecture, the original image is first resized to reduce its resolution, then a prediction is performed on it using a first transformer and the resulting prediction is reused together with the original-size image to perform a final prediction on a second transformer with less computation than a classical Vision transformer architecture. The early-exit process allows the model to make a final prediction at intermediate branches, saving even more computation. We evaluated our approach on CIFAR-10, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet. We obtained an equivalent accuracy to the classical Vision transformer model with only around 70% of FLOPs.]]></description>

At present, there are no easily understood explainable artificial intelligence (AI) methods for discrete token inputs, like text. Most explainable AI techniques do not extend well to token sequences, where both local and global features matter, because state-of-the-art models, like transformers, tend to focus on global connections. Therefore, existing explainable AI algorithms fail by (i) identifying disparate tokens of importance, or (ii) assigning a large number of tokens a low value of importance. This method for explainable AI for tokens-based classifiers generalizes a mask-based explainable AI algorithm for images. It starts with an Explainer neural network that is trained to create masks to hide information not relevant for classification. Then, the Hadamard product of the mask and the continuous values of the classifier's embedding layer is taken and passed through the classifier, changing the magnitude of the embedding vector but keeping the orientation unchanged. The Explainer is trained for a taxonomic classifier for nucleotide sequences and it is shown that the masked segments are less relevant to classification than the unmasked ones. This method focused on the importance the token as a whole (i.e., a segment of the input sequence), producing a human-readable explanation.]]></description>

We present a method for generating a full 360° orbit video around a person from a single input image. Existing methods typically adapt image-based diffusion models for multi-view synthesis, but yield inconsistent results across views and with the original identity. In contrast, recent video diffusion models have demonstrated their ability in generating photorealistic results that align well with the given prompts. Inspired by these results, we propose HumanOrbit, a video diffusion model for multi-view human image generation. Our approach enables the model to synthesize continuous camera rotations around the subject, producing geometrically consistent novel views while preserving the appearance and identity of the person. Using the generated multi-view frames, we further propose a reconstruction pipeline that recovers a textured mesh of the subject. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of HumanOrbit for multi-view image generation and that the reconstructed 3D models exhibit superior completeness and fidelity compared to those from state-of-the-art baselines.]]></description>

In many applications, evaluating the effectiveness of different alternatives comes with varying costs or resource usage. Motivated by such heterogeneity, we study the Best Arm Identification with Resource Constraints (BAIwRC) problem, where an agent seeks to identify the best alternative (aka arm) in the presence of resource constraints. Each arm pull consumes one or more types of limited resources. We make two key contributions. First, we propose the Successive Halving with Resource Rationing (SH-RR) algorithm, which integrates resource-aware allocation into the classical successive halving framework on best arm identification. The SH-RR algorithm unifies the theoretical analysis for both the stochastic and deterministic consumption settings, with a new \textit{effective consumption measure]]></description>

Decoupled dataset distillation (DD) compresses large corpora into a few synthetic images by matching a frozen teacher's statistics. However, current residual-matching pipelines rely on static real patches, creating a fit-complexity gap and a pull-to-anchor effect that reduce intra-class diversity and hurt generalization. To address these issues, we introduce RETA -- a Retrieval and Topology Alignment framework for decoupled DD. First, Dynamic Retrieval Connection (DRC) selects a real patch from a prebuilt pool by minimizing a fit-complexity score in teacher feature space; the chosen patch is injected via a residual connection to tighten feature fit while controlling injected complexity. Second, Persistent Topology Alignment (PTA) regularizes synthesis with persistent homology: we build a mutual k-NN feature graph, compute persistence images of components and loops, and penalize topology discrepancies between real and synthetic sets, mitigating pull-to-anchor effect. Across CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, ImageNet-1K, and multiple ImageNet subsets, RETA consistently outperforms various baselines under comparable time and memory, especially reaching 64.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ResNet-18 at 50 images per class, +3.1% over the best prior.]]></description>

Mobile Agents can autonomously execute user instructions, which requires hybrid-capabilities reasoning, including screen summary, subtask planning, action decision and action function. However, existing agents struggle to achieve both decoupled enhancement and balanced integration of these capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose Channel-of-Mobile-Experts (CoME), a novel agent architecture consisting of four distinct experts, each aligned with a specific reasoning stage, CoME activates the corresponding expert to generate output tokens in each reasoning stage via output-oriented activation. To empower CoME with hybrid-capabilities reasoning, we introduce a progressive training strategy: Expert-FT enables decoupling and enhancement of different experts' capability; Router-FT aligns expert activation with the different reasoning stage; CoT-FT facilitates seamless collaboration and balanced optimization across multiple capabilities. To mitigate error propagation in hybrid-capabilities reasoning, we propose InfoGain-Driven DPO (Info-DPO), which uses information gain to evaluate the contribution of each intermediate step, thereby guiding CoME toward more informative reasoning. Comprehensive experiments show that CoME outperforms dense mobile agents and MoE methods on both AITZ and AMEX datasets.]]></description>

Recognizing surgical phases and steps from video is a fundamental problem in computer-assisted interventions. Recent approaches increasingly rely on large-scale pre-training on thousands of labeled surgical videos, followed by zero-shot transfer to specific procedures. While effective, this strategy incurs substantial computational and data collection costs. In this work, we question whether such heavy pre-training is truly necessary. We propose Text-Augmented Action Segmentation Optimal Transport (TASOT), an unsupervised method for surgical phase and step recognition that extends Action Segmentation Optimal Transport (ASOT) by incorporating textual information generated directly from the videos. TASOT formulates temporal action segmentation as a multimodal optimal transport problem, where the matching cost is defined as a weighted combination of visual and text-based costs. The visual term captures frame-level appearance similarity, while the text term provides complementary semantic cues, and both are jointly regularized through a temporally consistent unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein formulation. This design enables effective alignment between video frames and surgical actions without surgical-specific pretraining or external web-scale supervision. We evaluate TASOT on multiple benchmark surgical datasets and observe consistent and substantial improvements over existing zero-shot methods, including StrasBypass70 (+23.7), BernBypass70 (+4.5), Cholec80 (+16.5), and AutoLaparo (+19.6). These results demonstrate that fine-grained surgical understanding can be achieved by exploiting information already present in standard visual and textual representations, without resorting to increasingly complex pre-training pipelines. The code will be available at https://github.com/omar8ahmed9/TASOT.]]></description>

Recent significant advances in 3D scene representation have been driven by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which has enabled real-time rendering with photorealistic quality. 3DGS often requires a large number of primitives to achieve high fidelity, leading to redundant representations and high resource consumption, thereby limiting its scalability for complex or large-scale scenes. Consequently, effective pruning strategies and more expressive primitives that can reduce redundancy while preserving visual quality are crucial for practical deployment. We propose an efficient, integrated reconstruction-aware pruning strategy that adaptively determines pruning timing and refining intervals based on reconstruction quality, thus reducing model size while enhancing rendering quality. Moreover, we introduce a 3D Difference-of-Gaussians primitive that jointly models both positive and negative densities in a single primitive, improving the expressiveness of Gaussians under compact configurations. Our method significantly improves model compactness, achieving up to 90\% reduction in Gaussian-count while delivering visual quality that is similar to, or in some cases better than, that produced by state-of-the-art methods. Code will be made publicly available.]]></description>

The expansion of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into multimodal domains has intensified the challenge for processing complex visual documents, such as financial reports. While page-level chunking and retrieval is a natural starting point, it creates a critical bottleneck: delivering entire pages to the generator introduces excessive extraneous context. This not only overloads the generator's attention mechanism but also dilutes the most salient evidence. Moreover, compressing these information-rich pages into a limited visual token budget further increases the risk of hallucinations. To address this, we introduce AgenticOCR, a dynamic parsing paradigm that transforms optical character recognition (OCR) from a static, full-text process into a query-driven, on-demand extraction system. By autonomously analyzing document layout in a "thinking with images" manner, AgenticOCR identifies and selectively recognizes regions of interest. This approach performs on-demand decompression of visual tokens precisely where needed, effectively decoupling retrieval granularity from rigid page-level chunking. AgenticOCR has the potential to serve as the "third building block" of the visual document RAG stack, operating alongside and enhancing standard Embedding and Reranking modules. Experimental results demonstrate that AgenticOCR improves both the efficiency and accuracy of visual RAG systems, achieving expert-level performance in long document understanding. Code and models are available at https://github.com/OpenDataLab/AgenticOCR.]]></description>

In 3D point cloud object tracking, the motion-centric methods have emerged as a promising avenue due to its superior performance in modeling inter-frame motion. However, existing two-stage motion-based approaches suffer from fundamental limitations: (1) error accumulation due to decoupled optimization caused by explicit foreground segmentation prior to motion estimation, and (2) computational bottlenecks from sequential processing. To address these challenges, we propose FocusTrack, a novel one-stage paradigms tracking framework that unifies motion-semantics co-modeling through two core innovations: Inter-frame Motion Modeling (IMM) and Focus-and-Suppress Attention. The IMM module employs a temp-oral-difference siamese encoder to capture global motion patterns between adjacent frames. The Focus-and-Suppress attention that enhance the foreground semantics via motion-salient feature gating and suppress the background noise based on the temporal-aware motion context from IMM without explicit segmentation. Based on above two designs, FocusTrack enables end-to-end training with compact one-stage pipeline. Extensive experiments on prominent 3D tracking benchmarks, such as KITTI, nuScenes, and Waymo, demonstrate that the FocusTrack achieves new SOTA performance while running at a high speed with 105 FPS.]]></description>

In a typical two-phase design, a random sample is drawn from the target population in phase 1, during which only a subset of variables is collected. In phase 2, a subsample of the phase-1 cohort is selected, and additional variables are measured. This setting induces a coarsened data structure on the data from the second phase. We assume coarsening at random, that is, the phase-2 sampling mechanism depends only on variables fully observed. We review existing estimators, including the generalized raking estimator and the inverse probability of censoring weighted targeted maximum likelihood estimation (IPCW-TMLE) along with its extensions that also target the phase-2 sampling mechanism to improve efficiency. We further introduce a new class of estimators constructed within the TMLE framework that are asymptotically equivalent.]]></description>

Large-scale homogeneous detectors with optical readouts are widely used in particle detection, with Cherenkov and scintillator neutrino detectors as prominent examples. Analyses in experimental physics rely on high-fidelity simulators to translate sensor-level information into physical quantities of interest. This task critically depends on accurate calibration, which aligns simulation behavior with real detector data, and on tracking, which infers particle properties from optical signals. We present the first end-to-end differentiable optical particle detector simulator, enabling simultaneous calibration and reconstruction through gradient-based optimization. Our approach unifies simulation, calibration, and tracking, which are traditionally treated as separate problems, within a single differentiable framework. We demonstrate that it achieves smooth and physically meaningful gradients across all key stages of light generation, propagation, and detection while maintaining computational efficiency. We show that gradient-based calibration and reconstruction greatly simplify existing analysis pipelines while matching or surpassing the performance of conventional non-differentiable methods in both accuracy and speed. Moreover, the framework's modularity allows straightforward adaptation to diverse detector geometries and target materials, providing a flexible foundation for experiment design and optimization. The results demonstrate the readiness of this technique for adoption in current and future optical detector experiments, establishing a new paradigm for simulation and reconstruction in particle physics.]]></description>

This study presents the first systematic, reference-free human evaluation of large language model (LLM) machine translation (MT) for Ancient Greek (AG) technical prose. We evaluate translations by three commercial LLMs (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT) of twenty paragraph-length passages from two works by the Greek physician Galen of Pergamum (ca. 129-216 CE): On Mixtures, which has two published English translations, and On the Composition of Drugs according to Kinds, which has never been fully translated into English. We assess translation quality using both standard automated evaluation metrics (BLEU, chrF++, METEOR, ROUGE-L, BERTScore, COMET, BLEURT) and expert human evaluation via a modified Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework applied to all 60 translations by a team of domain specialists. On the previously translated expository text, LLMs achieved high translation quality (mean MQM score 95.2/100), with performance approaching expert level. On the untranslated pharmacological text, aggregate quality was lower (79.9/100) but with high variance driven by two passages presenting extreme terminological density; excluding these, scores converged to within 4 points of the translated text. Terminology rarity, operationalized via corpus frequency in the literary Diorisis Ancient Greek Corpus, emerged as a strong predictor of translation failure (r = -.97 for passage-level quality on the untranslated text). Automated metrics showed moderate correlation with human judgment overall on the text with a wide quality spread (Composition), but no metric discriminated among high-quality translations. We discuss implications for the use of LLMs in Classical scholarship and for the design of automated evaluation pipelines for low-resource ancient languages.]]></description>

Open RAN (O-RAN) exposes rich control and telemetry interfaces across the Non-RT RIC, Near-RT RIC, and distributed units, but also makes it harder to operate multi-tenant, multi-objective RANs in a safe and auditable manner. In parallel, agentic AI systems with explicit planning, tool use, memory, and self-management offer a natural way to structure long-lived control loops. This article surveys how such agentic controllers can be brought into O-RAN: we review the O-RAN architecture, contrast agentic controllers with conventional ML/RL xApps, and organise the task landscape around three clusters: network slice life-cycle, radio resource management (RRM) closed loops, and cross-cutting security, privacy, and compliance. We then introduce a small set of agentic primitives (Plan-Act-Observe-Reflect, skills as tool use, memory and evidence, and self-management gates) and show, in a multi-cell O-RAN simulation, how they improve slice life-cycle and RRM performance compared to conventional baselines and ablations that remove individual primitives. Security, privacy, and compliance are discussed as architectural constraints and open challenges for standards-aligned deployments. This framework achieves an average 8.83\% reduction in resource usage across three classic network slices.]]></description>

Vision-language models (VLMs) show promise in drafting radiology reports, yet they frequently suffer from logical inconsistencies, generating diagnostic impressions unsupported by their own perceptual findings or missing logically entailed conclusions. Standard lexical metrics heavily penalize clinical paraphrasing and fail to capture these deductive failures in reference-free settings. Toward guarantees for clinical reasoning, we introduce a neurosymbolic verification framework that deterministically audits the internal consistency of VLM-generated reports. Our pipeline autoformalizes free-text radiographic findings into structured propositional evidence, utilizing an SMT solver (Z3) and a clinical knowledge base to verify whether each diagnostic claim is mathematically entailed, hallucinated, or omitted. Evaluating seven VLMs across five chest X-ray benchmarks, our verifier exposes distinct reasoning failure modes, such as conservative observation and stochastic hallucination, that remain invisible to traditional metrics. On labeled datasets, enforcing solver-backed entailment acts as a rigorous post-hoc guarantee, systematically eliminating unsupported hallucinations to significantly increase diagnostic soundness and precision in generative clinical assistants.]]></description>

Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models. However, standard outcome-based supervision suffers from a critical limitation that penalizes trajectories that are largely correct but fail due to several missteps as heavily as completely erroneous ones. This coarse feedback signal causes the model to discard valuable largely correct rollouts, leading to a degradation in rollout diversity that prematurely narrows the exploration space. Process Reward Models have demonstrated efficacy in providing reliable step-wise verification for test-time scaling, naively integrating these signals into RLVR as dense rewards proves ineffective.Prior methods attempt to introduce off-policy guided whole-trajectory replacement that often outside the policy model's distribution, but still fail to utilize the largely correct rollouts generated by the model itself and thus do not effectively mitigate the narrowing of the exploration space. To address these issues, we propose SCOPE (Step-wise Correction for On-Policy Exploration), a novel framework that utilizes Process Reward Models to pinpoint the first erroneous step in suboptimal rollouts and applies fine-grained, step-wise off-policy rectification. By applying precise refinement on partially correct rollout, our method effectively salvages partially correct trajectories and increases diversity score by 13.5%, thereby sustaining a broad exploration space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach establishes new state-of-the-art results, achieving an average accuracy of 46.6% on math reasoning and exhibiting robust generalization with 53.4% accuracy on out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.]]></description>

Can narratives make arguments more persuasive? And to this end, which narrative features matter most? Although stories are often seen as powerful tools for persuasion, their specific role in online, unstructured argumentation remains underexplored. To address this gap, we present ARGUS, a framework for studying the impact of narration on persuasion in argumentative discourse. ARGUS introduces a new ChangeMyView corpus annotated for story presence and six key narrative features, integrating insights from two established theoretical frameworks that capture both textual narrative features and their effects on recipients. Leveraging both encoder-based classifiers and zero-shot large language models (LLMs), ARGUS identifies stories and narrative features and applies them at scale to examine how different narrative dimensions influence persuasion success in online argumentation.]]></description>

This paper presents the Artificial Agency Program (AAP), a position and research agenda for building AI systems as reality embedded, resource-bounded agents whose development is driven by curiosity-as-learning-progress under physical and computational constraints. The central thesis is that AI is most useful when treated as part of an extended human--tool system that increases sensing, understanding, and actuation capability while reducing friction at the interface between people, tools, and environments. The agenda unifies predictive compression, intrinsic motivation, empowerment and control, interface quality (unification), and language/self-communication as selective information bottlenecks. We formulate these ideas as a falsifiable program with explicit costs, staged experiments, and a concrete multimodal tokenized testbed in which an agent allocates limited budget among observation, action, and deliberation. The aim is to provide a conceptual and experimental framework that connects intrinsic motivation, information theory, thermodynamics, bounded rationality, and modern reasoning systems]]></description>

Winter road maintenance is critical for ensuring public safety and reducing environmental impacts, yet existing methods struggle to manage large-scale routing problems effectively and mostly reply on human decision. This study presents a novel, scalable bi-level optimization framework, validated on real operational data on UK strategic road networks (M25, M6, A1), including interconnected local road networks in surrounding areas for vehicle traversing, as part of the highway operator's efforts to solve existing planning challenges. At the upper level, a reinforcement learning (RL) agent strategically partitions the road network into manageable clusters and optimally allocates resources from multiple depots. At the lower level, a multi-objective vehicle routing problem (VRP) is solved within each cluster, minimizing the maximum vehicle travel time and total carbon emissions. Unlike existing approaches, our method handles large-scale, real-world networks efficiently, explicitly incorporating vehicle-specific constraints, depot capacities, and road segment requirements. Results demonstrate significant improvements, including balanced workloads, reduced maximum travel times below the targeted two-hour threshold, lower emissions, and substantial cost savings. This study illustrates how advanced AI-driven bi-level optimization can directly enhance operational decision-making in real-world transportation and logistics.]]></description>

Simulation is essential to the development and evaluation of autonomous robots such as self-driving vehicles. Neural reconstruction is emerging as a promising solution as it enables simulating a wide variety of scenarios from real-world data alone in an automated and scalable way. However, while methods such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting can produce visually compelling results, they often exhibit artifacts particularly when rendering novel views, and fail to realistically integrate inserted dynamic objects, especially when they were captured from different scenes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DiffusionHarmonizer, an online generative enhancement framework that transforms renderings from such imperfect scenes into temporally consistent outputs while improving their realism. At its core is a single-step temporally-conditioned enhancer that is converted from a pretrained multi-step image diffusion model, capable of running in online simulators on a single GPU. The key to training it effectively is a custom data curation pipeline that constructs synthetic-real pairs emphasizing appearance harmonization, artifact correction, and lighting realism. The result is a scalable system that significantly elevates simulation fidelity in both research and production environments.]]></description>

Machine learning models -- including large language models (LLMs) -- are often said to exhibit monoculture, where outputs agree strikingly often. But what does it actually mean for models to agree too much? We argue that this question is inherently subjective, relying on two key decisions.
  First, the analyst must specify a baseline null model for what "independence" should look like. This choice is inherently subjective, and as we show, different null models result in dramatically different inferences about excess agreement. Second, we show that inferences depend on the population of models and items under consideration. Models that seem highly correlated in one context may appear independent when evaluated on a different set of questions, or against a different set of peers. Experiments on two large-scale benchmarks validate our theoretical findings. For example, we find drastically different inferences when using a null model with item difficulty compared to previous works that do not. Together, our results reframe monoculture evaluation not as an absolute property of model behavior, but as a context-dependent inference problem.]]></description>

Learning directly from boundary representations (B-reps) has significantly advanced 3D CAD analysis. However, state-of-the-art B-rep learning methods rely on absolute coordinates and normals to encode global context, making them highly sensitive to rotations. Our experiments reveal that models achieving over 95% accuracy on aligned benchmarks can collapse to as low as 10% under arbitrary $\mathbf{SO}(3)$ rotations. To address this, we introduce FoV-Net, the first B-rep learning framework that captures both local surface geometry and global structural context in a rotation-invariant manner. Each face is represented by a Local Reference Frame (LRF) UV-grid that encodes its local surface geometry, and by Field-of-View (FoV) grids that capture the surrounding 3D context by casting rays and recording intersections with neighboring faces. Lightweight CNNs extract per-face features, which are propagated over the B-rep graph using a graph attention network. FoV-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on B-rep classification and segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating robustness to arbitrary rotations while also requiring less training data to achieve strong results.]]></description>

Cox processes model overdispersed point process data via a latent stochastic intensity, but both nonparametric estimation of the intensity model and posterior inference over intensity paths are typically intractable, relying on expensive MCMC methods. We introduce Neural Diffusion Intensity Models, a variational framework for Cox processes driven by neural SDEs. Our key theoretical result, based on enlargement of filtrations, shows that conditioning on point process observations preserves the diffusion structure of the latent intensity with an explicit drift correction. This guarantees the variational family contains the true posterior, so that ELBO maximization coincides with maximum likelihood estimation under sufficient model capacity. We design an amortized encoder architecture that maps variable-length event sequences to posterior intensity paths by simulating the drift-corrected SDE, replacing repeated MCMC runs with a single forward pass. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate accurate recovery of latent intensity dynamics and posterior paths, with orders-of-magnitude speedups over MCMC-based methods.]]></description>

Resource-efficient training optimization techniques are becoming increasingly important as the size of large language models (LLMs) continues to grow. In particular, batch packing is commonly used in pre-training and supervised fine-tuning to achieve resource-efficient training. We propose preference packing, a method to enhance resource efficiency in training techniques that use data with different responses for the same input prompt, such as reward models or Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Preference packing improves resource efficiency by reducing the attention operations for duplicate input prompts and decreasing KV cache memory usage. We conducted experiments on text-only datasets and image-included datasets and achieved at least 37% reduction in training time. Notably, this method can be applied alongside existing optimization techniques such as batch sorting, resulting in a 3.22x speedup.]]></description>

We propose ACWI (Adaptive Correlation Weighted Intrinsic), an adaptive intrinsic reward scaling framework designed to dynamically balance intrinsic and extrinsic rewards for improved exploration in sparse reward reinforcement learning. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on manually tuned scalar coefficients, which often result in unstable or suboptimal performance across tasks, ACWI learns a state dependent scaling coefficient online. Specifically, ACWI introduces a lightweight Beta Network that predicts the intrinsic reward weight directly from the agent state through an encoder based architecture. The scaling mechanism is optimized using a correlation based objective that encourages alignment between the weighted intrinsic rewards and discounted future extrinsic returns. This formulation enables task adaptive exploration incentives while preserving computational efficiency and training stability. We evaluate ACWI on a suite of sparse reward environments in MiniGrid. Experimental results demonstrate that ACWI consistently improves sample efficiency and learning stability compared to fixed intrinsic reward baselines, achieving superior performance with minimal computational overhead.]]></description>

The pursuit of human-like conversational agents has long been guided by the Turing test. For modern speech-to-speech (S2S) systems, a critical yet unanswered question is whether they can converse like humans. To tackle this, we conduct the first Turing test for S2S systems, collecting 2,968 human judgments on dialogues between 9 state-of-the-art S2S systems and 28 human participants. Our results deliver a clear finding: no existing evaluated S2S system passes the test, revealing a significant gap in human-likeness. To diagnose this failure, we develop a fine-grained taxonomy of 18 human-likeness dimensions and crowd-annotate our collected dialogues accordingly. Our analysis shows that the bottleneck is not semantic understanding but stems from paralinguistic features, emotional expressivity, and conversational persona. Furthermore, we find that off-the-shelf AI models perform unreliably as Turing test judges. In response, we propose an interpretable model that leverages the fine-grained human-likeness ratings and delivers accurate and transparent human-vs-machine discrimination, offering a powerful tool for automatic human-likeness evaluation. Our work establishes the first human-likeness evaluation for S2S systems and moves beyond binary outcomes to enable detailed diagnostic insights, paving the way for human-like improvements in conversational AI systems.]]></description>

Recently, there have been significant advancements in music generation. However, existing models primarily focus on creating modern pop songs, making it challenging to produce ancient music with distinct rhythms and styles, such as ancient Chinese SongCi. In this paper, we introduce SongSong, the first music generation model capable of restoring Chinese SongCi to our knowledge. Our model first predicts the melody from the input SongCi, then separately generates the singing voice and accompaniment based on that melody, and finally combines all elements to create the final piece of music. Additionally, to address the lack of ancient music datasets, we create OpenSongSong, a comprehensive dataset of ancient Chinese SongCi music, featuring 29.9 hours of compositions by various renowned SongCi music masters. To assess SongSong's proficiency in performing SongCi, we randomly select 85 SongCi sentences that were not part of the training set for evaluation against SongSong and music generation platforms such as Suno and SkyMusic. The subjective and objective outcomes indicate that our proposed model achieves leading performance in generating high-quality SongCi music.]]></description>

Leveraging non-linear dimension reduction techniques, we remove the low dimension constraint from node embedding and propose COVE, an explainable high dimensional embedding that, when reduced to low dimension with UMAP, slightly increases performance on clustering and link prediction tasks. The embedding is inspired by neural embedding methods that use co-occurrence on a random walk as an indication of similarity, and is closely related to a diffusion process. Extending on recent community detection benchmarks, we find that a COVE UMAP HDBSCAN pipeline performs similarly to the popular Louvain algorithm.]]></description>

Large language model (LLM) agents, such as OpenAI's Operator and Claude's Computer Use, can automate workflows but unable to handle payment tasks. Existing agentic solutions have gained significant attention; however, even the latest approaches face challenges in implementing end-to-end agentic payment workflows. To address this gap, this research proposes the Hierarchical Multi-Agent System for Payments (HMASP), which provides an end-to-end agentic method for completing payment workflows. The proposed HMASP leverages either open-weight or proprietary LLMs and employs a modular architecture consisting of the Conversational Payment Agent (CPA - first agent level), Supervisor agents (second agent level), Routing agents (third agent level), and the Process summary agent (fourth agent level). The CPA serves as the central entry point, handling all external requests and coordinating subsequent tasks across hierarchical levels. HMASP incorporates architectural patterns that enable modular task execution across agents and levels for payment operations, including shared state variables, decoupled message states, and structured handoff protocols that facilitate coordination across agents and workflows. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed HMASP. To our knowledge, HMASP is the first LLM-based multi-agent system to implement end-to-end agentic payment workflows. This work lays a foundation for extending agentic capabilities into the payment domain.]]></description>

Path signatures provide a rich representation of sequential data, with strong theoretical guarantees and good performance in a variety of machine-learning tasks. While signatures have progressed from fixed feature extractors to trainable components of machine-learning models, existing libraries often lack the required scalability for large-scale, gradient-based learning. To address this gap, this paper introduces pathsig, a PyTorch-native library that computes path signatures directly in the word basis. By using CUDA kernels to update signature coefficients in parallel over prefix-closed word sets, pathsig achieves high GPU throughput and near-minimal peak memory. Compared with other libraries, pathsig achieves 10-30x speedups for computation of truncated signatures and up to 4-10x speedups in training that require backpropagation through the signature. Beyond regular truncation, pathsig supports projections of the (infinite-dimensional) signature onto user-specified sets of words and anisotropic truncation motivated by inhomogeneous path regularity, enabling more compact representations that can reduce dimensionality, redundancy, and computational cost.]]></description>

Recent advancements in neural surface reconstruction have significantly enhanced 3D reconstruction. However, current real world datasets mainly focus on benchmarking multiview stereo (MVS) based on RGB inputs. Multiview photometric stereo (MVPS) and multiview shape from polarization (MVSfP), though indispensable on high-fidelity surface reconstruction and sparse inputs, have not been quantitatively assessed together with MVS. To determine the working range of different MVX (MVS, MVSfP, and MVPS) techniques, we propose EvalMVX, a real-world dataset containing $25$ objects, each captured with a polarized camera under $20$ varying views and $17$ light conditions including OLAT and natural illumination, leading to $8,500$ images. Each object includes aligned ground-truth 3D mesh, facilitating quantitative benchmarking of MVX methods simultaneously. Based on our EvalMVX, we evaluate $13$ MVX methods published in recent years, record the best-performing methods, and identify open problems under diverse geometric details and reflectance types. We hope EvalMVX and the benchmarking results can inspire future research on multiview 3D reconstruction.]]></description>

Large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities have fueled a compelling narrative that reasoning universally improves performance across language tasks. We test this claim through a comprehensive evaluation of 504 configurations across seven model families--including adaptive, conditional, and reinforcement learning-based reasoning architectures--on sentiment analysis datasets of varying granularity (binary, five-class, and 27-class emotion). Our findings reveal that reasoning effectiveness is strongly task-dependent, challenging prevailing assumptions: (1) Reasoning shows task-complexity dependence--binary classification degrades up to -19.9 F1 percentage points (pp), while 27-class emotion recognition gains up to +16.0pp; (2) Distilled reasoning variants underperform base models by 3-18 pp on simpler tasks, though few-shot prompting enables partial recovery; (3) Few-shot learning improves over zero-shot in most cases regardless of model type, with gains varying by architecture and task complexity; (4) Pareto frontier analysis shows base models dominate efficiency-performance trade-offs, with reasoning justified only for complex emotion recognition despite 2.1x-54x computational overhead. We complement these quantitative findings with qualitative error analysis revealing that reasoning degrades simpler tasks through systematic over-deliberation, offering mechanistic insight beyond the high-level overthinking hypothesis.]]></description>

Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective technique for alleviating the substantial computational and memory overheads of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by compressing both weights and activations without retraining the full model. Existing PTQ methods primarily rely on static identification and global compensation of sensitive or outlier channels, yet they often overlook the distributional differences of these important channels across inputs, leading to unsatisfactory quantization. In this work, we observe that the distributions and occurrence frequencies of important channels vary significantly both across modalities and among tokens, even within the same modality. Accordingly, we propose \textbf{Quant Experts (QE)}, a token-aware adaptive error compensation with mixture-of-experts for VLMs quantization. QE divides the important channels into token-independent and token-dependent groups. For the former, a shared expert is designed for most tokens to compensate for global quantization error using a low-rank adapter. For the latter, routed experts including multiple routed low-rank adapters are elaborated to compensate for local quantization error related to specific tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QE consistently enhances task accuracy across various quantization settings and model scales, ranging from 2B to 70B parameters, while maintaining performance comparable to full-precision models.]]></description>

This paper proposes CIRCLE, a six-stage, lifecycle-based framework to bridge the reality gap between model-centric performance metrics and AI's materialized outcomes in deployment. While existing frameworks like MLOps focus on system stability and benchmarks measure abstract capabilities, decision-makers outside the AI stack lack systematic evidence about the behavior of AI technologies under real-world user variability and constraints. CIRCLE operationalizes the Validation phase of TEVV (Test, Evaluation, Verification, and Validation) by formalizing the translation of stakeholder concerns outside the stack into measurable signals. Unlike participatory design, which often remains localized, or algorithmic audits, which are often retrospective, CIRCLE provides a structured, prospective protocol for linking context-sensitive qualitative insights to scalable quantitative metrics. By integrating methods such as field testing, red teaming, and longitudinal studies into a coordinated pipeline, CIRCLE produces systematic knowledge: evidence that is comparable across sites yet sensitive to local context. This can enable governance based on materialized downstream effects rather than theoretical capabilities.]]></description>

The growth and heterogeneity of IoT devices create security challenges where static identification models can degrade as traffic evolves. This paper presents a two-stage, flow-feature-based pipeline for unsupervised IoT device traffic profiling and incremental model updating, evaluated on selected long-duration captures from the Deakin IoT dataset. For baseline profiling, density-based clustering (DBSCAN) isolates a substantial outlier portion of the data and produces the strongest alignment with ground-truth device labels among tested classical methods (NMI 0.78), outperforming centroid-based clustering on cluster purity. For incremental adaptation, we evaluate stream-oriented clustering approaches and find that BIRCH supports efficient updates (0.13 seconds per update) and forms comparatively coherent clusters for a held-out novel device (purity 0.87), but with limited capture of novel traffic (share 0.72) and a measurable trade-off in known-device accuracy after adaptation (0.71). Overall, the results highlight a practical trade-off between high-purity static profiling and the flexibility of incremental clustering for evolving IoT environments.]]></description>

Large Language Model (LLM) adapters enable low-cost model specialization, but introduce complex caching and scheduling challenges in distributed serving systems where hundreds of adapters must be hosted concurrently. While prior work has largely focused on latency minimization, resource efficiency through throughput maximization remains underexplored. This paper presents a data-driven pipeline that, for a given workload, computes an adapter placement that serves the workload with the minimum number of GPUs while avoiding request starvation and GPU memory errors. To that end, the approach identifies the maximum feasible throughput attainable on each GPU by leveraging accurate performance predictions learned from real serving behavior. The proposed pipeline integrates three components: (i) a Digital Twin (DT) tailored to LLM-adapter serving, (ii) a distilled machine learning (ML) model trained on DT-generated data, and (iii) a greedy placement algorithm that exploits ML-based performance estimates to maximize GPU efficiency. The DT emulates real system dynamics with high fidelity, achieving below 5% throughput estimation error while executing up to 90 times faster than full LLM benchmarking across both predictable and unpredictable workloads. The learned ML models further accelerate performance estimation with marginal accuracy degradation, enabling scalable optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that the pipeline substantially improves GPU efficiency by reducing the number of GPUs required to sustain target workloads. Beyond GPU efficiency, the pipeline can be adapted to alternative objectives, such as latency minimization, highlighting its versatility for future large-scale LLM serving infrastructures.]]></description>

Reconstructing 3D clothed humans from monocular images and videos is a fundamental problem with applications in virtual try-on, avatar creation, and mixed reality. Despite significant progress in human body recovery, accurately reconstructing garment geometry, particularly for loose-fitting clothing, remains an open challenge. We propose a unified framework for high-fidelity 3D garment reconstruction from both single images and video sequences. Our approach combines Implicit Sewing Patterns (ISP) with a generative diffusion model to learn expressive garment shape priors in 2D UV space. Leveraging these priors, we introduce a mapping model that establishes correspondences between image pixels, UV pattern coordinates, and 3D geometry, enabling accurate and detailed garment reconstruction from single images. We further extend this formulation to dynamic reconstruction by introducing a spatio-temporal diffusion scheme with test-time guidance to enforce long-range temporal consistency. We also develop analytic projection-based constraints that preserve image-aligned geometry in visible regions while enforcing coherent completion in occluded areas over time. Although trained exclusively on synthetically simulated cloth data, our method generalizes well to real-world imagery and consistently outperforms existing approaches on both tight- and loose-fitting garments. The reconstructed garments preserve fine geometric detail while exhibiting realistic dynamic motion, supporting downstream applications such as texture editing, garment retargeting, and animation.]]></description>

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, yet they remain vulnerable to hallucination, where generated content deviates from visual evidence. Existing mitigation strategies either require costly supervision during training or introduce additional latency at inference time. Recent vision enhancement methods attempt to address this issue by reinforcing visual tokens during decoding, but they typically inject all tokens indiscriminately, which causes interference from background regions and distracts the model from critical cues. To overcome this challenge, we propose Adaptive Visual Reinforcement (AIR), a training-free framework for MLLMs. AIR consists of two components. Prototype-based token reduction condenses the large pool of visual tokens into a compact subset to suppress redundancy. OT-guided patch reinforcement quantifies the alignment between hidden states and patch embeddings to selectively integrate the most consistent patches into feed-forward layers. As a result, AIR enhances the model's reliance on salient visual information and effectively mitigates hallucination. Extensive experiments across representative MLLMs demonstrate that AIR substantially reduces hallucination while preserving general capabilities, establishing it as an effective solution for building reliable MLLMs.]]></description>

Reward models are central to aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Yet most approaches rely on pointwise reward estimates that overlook the epistemic uncertainty in reward models arising from limited human feedback. Recent work suggests that quantifying this uncertainty can reduce the costs of human annotation via uncertainty-guided active learning and mitigate reward overoptimization in LLM post-training. However, uncertainty-aware reward models have so far been adopted without thorough comparison, leaving them poorly understood. This work introduces a unified framework, RewardUQ, to systematically evaluate uncertainty quantification for reward models. We compare common methods along standard metrics measuring accuracy and calibration, and we propose a new ranking strategy incorporating both dimensions for a simplified comparison. Our experimental results suggest that model size and initialization have the most meaningful impact on performance, and most prior work could have benefited from alternative design choices. To foster the development and evaluation of new methods and aid the deployment in downstream applications, we release our open-source framework as a Python package. Our code is available at https://github.com/lasgroup/rewarduq.]]></description>

Market regime shifts induce distribution shifts that can degrade the performance of portfolio rebalancing policies. We propose macro-conditioned scenario-context rollout (SCR) that generates plausible next-day multivariate return scenarios under stress events. However, doing so faces new challenges, as history will never tell what would have happened differently. As a result, incorporating scenario-based rewards from rollouts introduces a reward--transition mismatch in temporal-difference learning, destabilizing RL critic training.
  We analyze this inconsistency and show it leads to a mixed evaluation target. Guided by this analysis, we construct a counterfactual next state using the rollout-implied continuations and augment the critic agent's bootstrap target. Doing so stabilizes the learning and provides a viable bias-variance tradeoff.
  In out-of-sample evaluations across 31 distinct universes of U.S. equity and ETF portfolios, our method improves Sharpe ratio by up to 76% and reduces maximum drawdown by up to 53% compared with classic and RL-based portfolio rebalancing baselines.]]></description>

Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning tasks, yet ensuring their safety remains a critical challenge. Recent input-side defenses detect unsafe images with CLIP and prepend safety prefixes to prompts, but they still suffer from inaccurate detection in complex scenes and unstable safety signals during decoding. To address these issues, we propose GuardAlign, a training-free defense framework that integrates two strategies. First, OT-enhanced safety detection leverages optimal transport to measure distribution distances between image patches and unsafe semantics, enabling accurate identification of malicious regions without additional computational cost. Second, cross-modal attentive calibration strengthens the influence of safety prefixes by adaptively reallocating attention across layers, ensuring that safety signals remain consistently activated throughout generation. Extensive evaluations on six representative MLLMs demonstrate that GuardAlign reduces unsafe response rates by up to 39% on SPA-VL, while preserving utility, achieving an improvement on VQAv2 from 78.51% to 79.21%.]]></description>

Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify abnormal events in videos. Traditional VAD methods generally suffer from the high costs of labeled data and full training, thus some recent works have explored leveraging frozen multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) in a tuning-free manner to perform VAD. However, their performance is limited as they directly inherit pre-training biases and cannot adapt internal representations to specific video contexts, leading to difficulties in handling subtle or ambiguous anomalies. To address these limitations, we propose a novel intervention framework, termed SteerVAD, which advances MLLM-based VAD by shifting from passively reading to actively steering and rectifying internal representations. Our approach first leverages the gradient-free representational separability analysis (RSA) to identify top attention heads as latent anomaly experts (LAEs) which are most discriminative for VAD. Then a hierarchical meta-controller (HMC) generates dynamic rectification signals by jointly conditioning on global context and these LAE outputs. The signals execute targeted, anisotropic scaling directly upon the LAE representation manifolds, amplifying anomaly-relevant dimensions while suppressing inherent biases. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among tuning-free approaches requiring only 1% of training data, establishing it as a powerful new direction for video anomaly detection. The code will be released upon the publication.]]></description>

3D super-resolution (3DSR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) 3D scenes from low-resolution (LR) multi-view images. Existing methods rely on dense LR inputs and per-scene optimization, which restricts the high-frequency priors for constructing HR 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to those inherited from pretrained 2D super-resolution (2DSR) models. This severely limits reconstruction fidelity, cross-scene generalization, and real-time usability. We propose to reformulate 3DSR as a direct feed-forward mapping from sparse LR views to HR 3DGS representations, enabling the model to autonomously learn 3D-specific high-frequency geometry and appearance from large-scale, multi-scene data. This fundamentally changes how 3DSR acquires high-frequency knowledge and enables robust generalization to unseen scenes. Specifically, we introduce SR3R, a feed-forward framework that directly predicts HR 3DGS representations from sparse LR views via the learned mapping network. To further enhance reconstruction fidelity, we introduce Gaussian offset learning and feature refinement, which stabilize reconstruction and sharpen high-frequency details. SR3R is plug-and-play and can be paired with any feed-forward 3DGS reconstruction backbone: the backbone provides an LR 3DGS scaffold, and SR3R upscales it to an HR 3DGS. Extensive experiments across three 3D benchmarks demonstrate that SR3R surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3DSR methods and achieves strong zero-shot generalization, even outperforming SOTA per-scene optimization methods on unseen scenes.]]></description>

The rapid advancement of Vision-Language models (VLMs) has raised growing concerns that their black-box reasoning processes could lead to unintended forms of social bias. Current debiasing approaches focus on mitigating surface-level bias signals through post-hoc learning or test-time algorithms, while leaving the internal dynamics of the model largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce an interpretable, model-agnostic bias mitigation framework, DeBiasLens, that localizes social attribute neurons in VLMs through sparse autoencoders (SAEs) applied to multimodal encoders. Building upon the disentanglement ability of SAEs, we train them on facial image or caption datasets without corresponding social attribute labels to uncover neurons highly responsive to specific demographics, including those that are underrepresented. By selectively deactivating the social neurons most strongly tied to bias for each group, we effectively mitigate socially biased behaviors of VLMs without degrading their semantic knowledge. Our research lays the groundwork for future auditing tools, prioritizing social fairness in emerging real-world AI systems.]]></description>

It has been suggested that generative image models such as diffusion models can improve performance on clinically relevant tasks by offering deep learning models supplementary training data. However, most conditional diffusion models treat disease stages as independent classes, ignoring the continuous nature of disease progression. This mismatch is problematic in medical imaging because continuous pathological processes are typically only observed through coarse, discrete but ordered labels as in ophthalmology for diabetic retinopathy (DR). We propose an ordinal latent diffusion model for generating color fundus images that explicitly incorporates the ordered structure of DR severity into the generation process. Instead of categorical conditioning, we used a scalar disease representation, enabling a smooth transition between adjacent stages. We evaluated our approach using visual realism metrics and classification-based clinical consistency analysis on the EyePACS dataset. Compared to a standard conditional diffusion model, our model reduced the Fréchet inception distance for four of the five DR stages and increased the quadratic weighted $κ$ from 0.79 to 0.87. Furthermore, interpolation experiments showed that the model captured a continuous spectrum of disease progression learned from ordered, coarse class labels.]]></description>

Contrastive learning has become a cornerstone of modern representation learning, allowing training with massive unlabeled data for both task-specific and general (foundation) models. A prototypical loss in contrastive training is InfoNCE and its variants. In this work, we show that the InfoNCE objective induces Gaussian structure in representations that emerge from contrastive training. We establish this result in two complementary regimes. First, we show that under certain alignment and concentration assumptions, projections of the high-dimensional representation asymptotically approach a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Next, under less strict assumptions, we show that adding a small asymptotically vanishing regularization term that promotes low feature norm and high feature entropy leads to similar asymptotic results. We support our analysis with experiments on synthetic and CIFAR-10 datasets across multiple encoder architectures and sizes, demonstrating consistent Gaussian behavior. This perspective provides a principled explanation for commonly observed Gaussianity in contrastive representations. The resulting Gaussian model enables principled analytical treatment of learned representations and is expected to support a wide range of applications in contrastive learning.]]></description>

Jailbreak techniques for large language models (LLMs) evolve faster than benchmarks, making robustness estimates stale and difficult to compare across papers due to drift in datasets, harnesses, and judging protocols. We introduce JAILBREAK FOUNDRY (JBF), a system that addresses this gap via a multi-agent workflow to translate jailbreak papers into executable modules for immediate evaluation within a unified harness. JBF features three core components: (i) JBF-LIB for shared contracts and reusable utilities; (ii) JBF-FORGE for the multi-agent paper-to-module translation; and (iii) JBF-EVAL for standardizing evaluations. Across 30 reproduced attacks, JBF achieves high fidelity with a mean (reproduced-reported) attack success rate (ASR) deviation of +0.26 percentage points. By leveraging shared infrastructure, JBF reduces attack-specific implementation code by nearly half relative to original repositories and achieves an 82.5% mean reused-code ratio. This system enables a standardized AdvBench evaluation of all 30 attacks across 10 victim models using a consistent GPT-4o judge. By automating both attack integration and standardized evaluation, JBF offers a scalable solution for creating living benchmarks that keep pace with the rapidly shifting security landscape.]]></description>

Protein function relies on dynamic conformational ensembles, yet current generative models like AlphaFold3 often fail to produce ensembles that match experimental data. Recent experiment-guided generators attempt to address this by steering the reverse diffusion process. However, these methods are limited by fixed sampling horizons and sensitivity to initialization, often yielding thermodynamically implausible results. We introduce a general inference-time optimization framework to solve these challenges. First, we optimize over latent representations to maximize ensemble log-likelihood, rather than perturbing structures post hoc. This approach eliminates dependence on diffusion length, removes initialization bias, and easily incorporates external constraints. Second, we present novel sampling schemes for drawing Boltzmann-weighted ensembles. By combining structural priors from AlphaFold3 with force-field-based priors, we sample from their product distribution while balancing experimental likelihoods. Our results show that this framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art guidance, improving diversity, physical energy, and agreement with data in X-ray crystallography and NMR, often fitting the experimental data better than deposited PDB structures. Finally, inference-time optimization experiments maximizing ipTM scores reveal that perturbing AlphaFold3 embeddings can artificially inflate model confidence. This exposes a vulnerability in current design metrics, whose mitigation could offer a pathway to reduce false discovery rates in binder engineering.]]></description>

Spanish is the official language of twenty-one countries and is spoken by over 441 million people. Naturally, there are many variations in how Spanish is spoken across these countries. Media platforms such as YouTube rely on automatic speech recognition systems to make their content accessible to different groups of users. However, YouTube offers only one option for automatically generating captions in Spanish. This raises the question: could this captioning system be biased against certain Spanish dialects? This study examines the potential biases in YouTube's automatic captioning system by analyzing its performance across various Spanish dialects. By comparing the quality of captions for female and male speakers from different regions, we identify systematic disparities which can be attributed to specific dialects. Our study provides further evidence that algorithmic technologies deployed on digital platforms need to be calibrated to the diverse needs and experiences of their user populations.]]></description>

The next generation of autonomous agents must not only learn efficiently but also act reliably and adapt their behavior in open worlds. Standard approaches typically assume fixed tasks and environments with little or no novelty, which limits world models' ability to support agents that must evolve their policies as conditions change. This paper outlines a vision for foundation world models: persistent, compositional representations that unify reinforcement learning, reactive/program synthesis, and abstraction mechanisms. We propose an agenda built around four components: (i) learnable reward models from specifications to support optimization with clear objectives; (ii) adaptive formal verification integrated throughout learning; (iii) online abstraction calibration to quantify the reliability of the model's predictions; and (iv) test-time synthesis and world-model generation guided by verifiers. Together, these components enable agents to synthesize verifiable programs, derive new policies from a small number of interactions, and maintain correctness while adapting to novelty. The resulting framework positions foundation world models as a substrate for learning, reasoning, and adaptation, laying the groundwork for agents that not only act well but can explain and justify the behavior they adopt.]]></description>

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder in which mild cognitive impairment (MCI) marks a critical transition between aging and dementia. Neuroimaging modalities, such as structural MRI, provide biomarkers of this transition; however, their high costs and infrastructure needs limit their deployment at a population scale. Speech analysis offers a non-invasive alternative, but speech-only classifiers are developed independently of neuroimaging, leaving decision boundaries biologically ungrounded and limiting reliability on the subtle CN-versus-MCI distinction. We propose MINT (Multimodal Imaging-to-Speech Knowledge Transfer), a three-stage cross-modal framework that transfers biomarker structure from MRI into a speech encoder at training time. An MRI teacher, trained on 1,228 subjects, defines a compact neuroimaging embedding space for CN-versus-MCI classification. A residual projection head aligns speech representations to this frozen imaging manifold via a combined geometric loss, adapting speech to the learned biomarker space while preserving imaging encoder fidelity. The frozen MRI classifier, which is never exposed to speech, is applied to aligned embeddings at inference and requires no scanner. Evaluation on ADNI-4 shows aligned speech achieves performance comparable to speech-only baselines (AUC 0.720 vs 0.711) while requiring no imaging at inference, demonstrating that MRI-derived decision boundaries can ground speech representations. Multimodal fusion improves over MRI alone (0.973 vs 0.958). Ablation studies identify dropout regularization and self-supervised pretraining as critical design decisions. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of MRI-to-speech knowledge transfer for early Alzheimer's screening, establishing a biologically grounded pathway for population-level cognitive triage without neuroimaging at inference.]]></description>

Real-world data frequently exhibit latent hierarchical structures, which can be naturally represented by hyperbolic geometry. Although recent hyperbolic neural networks have demonstrated promising results, many existing architectures remain partially intrinsic, mixing Euclidean operations with hyperbolic ones or relying on extrinsic parameterizations. To address it, we propose the \emph{Intrinsic Lorentz Neural Network} (ILNN), a fully intrinsic hyperbolic architecture that conducts all computations within the Lorentz model. At its core, the network introduces a novel \emph{point-to-hyperplane} fully connected layer (FC), replacing traditional Euclidean affine logits with closed-form hyperbolic distances from features to learned Lorentz hyperplanes, thereby ensuring that the resulting geometric decision functions respect the inherent curvature. Around this fundamental layer, we design intrinsic modules: GyroLBN, a Lorentz batch normalization that couples gyro-centering with gyro-scaling, consistently outperforming both LBN and GyroBN while reducing training time. We additionally proposed a gyro-additive bias for the FC output, a Lorentz patch-concatenation operator that aligns the expected log-radius across feature blocks via a digamma-based scale, and a Lorentz dropout layer. Extensive experiments conducted on CIFAR-10/100 and two genomic benchmarks (TEB and GUE) illustrate that ILNN achieves state-of-the-art performance and computational cost among hyperbolic models and consistently surpasses strong Euclidean baselines. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/Longchentong/ILNN}{\textcolor{magenta}{this url}}.]]></description>

The widespread use of smartphones has made photography ubiquitous, yet a clear gap remains between ordinary users and professional photographers, who can identify aesthetic issues and provide actionable shooting guidance during capture. We define this capability as aesthetic guidance (AG) -- an essential but largely underexplored domain in computational aesthetics. Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) primarily offer overly positive feedback, failing to identify issues or provide actionable guidance. Without AG capability, they cannot effectively identify distracting regions or optimize compositional balance, thus also struggling in aesthetic cropping, which aims to refine photo composition through reframing after capture. To address this, we introduce AesGuide, the first large-scale AG dataset and benchmark with 10,748 photos annotated with aesthetic scores, analyses, and guidance. Building upon it, we propose Venus, a two-stage framework that first empowers MLLMs with AG capability through progressively complex aesthetic questions and then activates their aesthetic cropping power via CoT-based rationales. Extensive experiments show that Venus substantially improves AG capability and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in aesthetic cropping, enabling interpretable and interactive aesthetic refinement across both stages of photo creation. Code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ICST-MIPL/Venus_CVPR2026.]]></description>

Offline reinforcement learning aims to learn an agent from pre-collected datasets, avoiding unsafe and inefficient real-time interaction. However, inevitable access to out-ofdistribution actions during the learning process introduces approximation errors, causing the error accumulation and considerable overestimation. In this paper, we construct a new pessimistic auxiliary policy for sampling reliable actions. Specifically, we develop a pessimistic auxiliary strategy by maximizing the lower confidence bound of the Q-function. The pessimistic auxiliary strategy exhibits a relatively high value and low uncertainty in the vicinity of the learned policy, avoiding the learned policy sampling high-value actions with potentially high errors during the learning process. Less approximation error introduced by sampled action from pessimistic auxiliary strategy leads to the alleviation of error accumulation. Extensive experiments on offline reinforcement learning benchmarks reveal that utilizing the pessimistic auxiliary strategy can effectively improve the efficacy of other offline RL approaches.]]></description>

Sycophancy, the tendency of large language models to favour user-affirming responses over critical engagement, has been identified as an alignment failure, particularly in high-stakes advisory and social contexts. While prior work has documented conversational features correlated with sycophancy, we lack a systematic understanding of what provokes or prevents AI sycophancy. Here, we present a set of controlled experimental studies where we first isolate how input framing influences sycophancy, and second, leverage these findings to develop mitigation strategies. In a nested factorial design, we compare questions to various non-questions where we vary three orthogonal factors: epistemic certainty (statement, belief, conviction), perspective (I- vs user-perspective), and affirmation vs negation. We show that (1) sycophancy is substantially higher in response to non-questions compared to questions. Additionally, we find that (2) sycophancy increases monotonically with epistemic certainty conveyed by the user, and (3) is amplified by I-perspective framing. Building on this, we show that asking a model to convert non-questions into questions before answering significantly reduces sycophancy. Importantly, this effect is stronger than a simple baseline prompt asking models "not to be sycophantic". Our work offers a practical and effective input-level mitigation that both developers and users can easily adopt.]]></description>

The evolution of video generation toward complex, multi-shot narratives has exposed a critical deficit in current evaluation methods. Existing benchmarks remain anchored to single-shot paradigms, lacking the comprehensive story assets and cross-shot metrics required to assess long-form coherence and appeal. To bridge this gap, we introduce MSVBench, the first comprehensive benchmark featuring hierarchical scripts and reference images tailored for Multi-Shot Video generation. We propose a hybrid evaluation framework that synergizes the high-level semantic reasoning of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with the fine-grained perceptual rigor of domain-specific expert models. Evaluating 20 video generation methods across diverse paradigms, we find that current models--despite strong visual fidelity--primarily behave as visual interpolators rather than true world models. We further validate the reliability of our benchmark by demonstrating a state-of-the-art Spearman's rank correlation of 94.4% with human judgments. Finally, MSVBench extends beyond evaluation by providing a scalable supervisory signal. Fine-tuning a lightweight model on its pipeline-refined reasoning traces yields human-aligned performance comparable to commercial models like Gemini-2.5-Flash.]]></description>

Masked discrete diffusion models (MDMs) are a promising new approach to generative modelling, offering the ability for parallel token generation and therefore greater efficiency than autoregressive counterparts. However, achieving an optimal balance between parallel generation and sample quality remains an open problem. Current approaches primarily address this issue through fixed, heuristic parallel sampling methods. There exist some recent learning based approaches to this problem, but its formulation from the perspective of variational inference remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a variational inference framework for learning parallel generation orders for MDMs. As part of our method, we propose a parameterisation for the approximate posterior of generation orders which facilitates parallelism and efficient sampling during training. Using this method, we conduct preliminary experiments on the GSM8K dataset, where our method performs competitively against heuristic sampling strategies in the regime of highly parallel generation. For example, our method achieves 33.1\% accuracy with an average of only only 4 generation steps, compared to 23.7-29.0\% accuracy achieved by standard competitor methods in the same number of steps. We believe further experiments and analysis of the method will yield valuable insights into the problem of parallel generation with MDMs.]]></description>

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient vision, but applying them to RGB visual tracking remains difficult: Existing SNN tracking frameworks either do not fully align with spike-driven computation or do not fully leverage neurons' spatiotemporal dynamics, leading to a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. To address this, we introduce SpikeTrack, a spike-driven framework for energy-efficient RGB object tracking. SpikeTrack employs a novel asymmetric design that uses asymmetric timestep expansion and unidirectional information flow, harnessing spatiotemporal dynamics while cutting computation. To ensure effective unidirectional information transfer between branches, we design a memory-retrieval module inspired by neural inference mechanisms. This module recurrently queries a compact memory initialized by the template to retrieve target cues and sharpen target perception over time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpikeTrack achieves the state-of-the-art among SNN-based trackers and remains competitive with advanced ANN trackers. Notably, it surpasses TransT on LaSOT dataset while consuming only 1/26 of its energy. To our knowledge, SpikeTrack is the first spike-driven framework to make RGB tracking both accurate and energy efficient. The code and models are available at https://github.com/faicaiwawa/SpikeTrack.]]></description>

Precise volumetric delineation of hippocampal structures is essential for quantifying neurodevelopmental trajectories in pre-term and term infants, where subtle morphological variations may carry prognostic significance. While foundation encoders trained on large-scale visual data offer discriminative representations, their 2D formulation is a limitation with respect to the $3$D organization of brain anatomy. We propose a volumetric segmentation strategy that reconciles this tension through a structured window-based disassembly-reassembly mechanism: the global MRI volume is decomposed into non-overlapping 3D windows or sub-cubes, each processed via a separate decoding arm built upon frozen high-fidelity features, and subsequently reassembled prior to a ground-truth correspendence using a dense-prediction head. This architecture preserves constant a decoder memory footprint while forcing predictions to lie within an anatomically consistent geometry. Evaluated on the ALBERT dataset for hippocampal segmentation, the proposed approach achieves a Dice score of 0.65 for a single 3D window. The method demonstrates that volumetric anatomical structure could be recovered from frozen 2D foundation representations through structured compositional decoding, and offers a principled and generalizable extension for foundation models for 3D medical applications.]]></description>

Rapid infarct assessment on non-contrast CT (NCCT) is essential for acute ischemic stroke management. Most deep learning methods perform pixel-wise segmentation without modeling the structured anatomical reasoning underlying ASPECTS scoring, where basal ganglia (BG) and supraganglionic (SG) levels are clinically interpreted in a coupled manner. We propose a clinically aligned framework that combines a frozen DINOv3 backbone with a lightweight decoder and introduce a Territory-Aware Gated Loss (TAGL) to enforce BG-SG consistency during training. This anatomically informed supervision adds no inference-time complexity. Our method achieves a Dice score of 0.6385 on AISD, outperforming prior CNN and foundation-model baselines. On a proprietary ASPECTS dataset, TAGL improves mean Dice from 0.698 to 0.767. These results demonstrate that integrating foundation representations with structured clinical priors improves NCCT stroke segmentation and ASPECTS delineation.]]></description>

How natural speech is represented in the brain constitutes a major challenge for cognitive neuroscience, with cortical envelope-following responses playing a central role in speech decoding. This paper presents our approach to the Speech Detection task in the LibriBrain Competition 2025, utilizing over 50 hours of magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals from a single participant listening to LibriVox audiobooks. We introduce the proposed Sequential Hierarchical Integration Network for EEG and MEG (SHINE) to reconstruct the binary speech-silence sequences from MEG signals. In the Extended Track, we further incorporated auxiliary reconstructions of speech envelopes and Mel spectrograms to enhance training. Ensemble methods combining SHINE with baselines (BrainMagic, AWavNet, ConvConcatNet) achieved F1-macro scores of 0.9155 (Standard Track) and 0.9184 (Extended Track) on the leaderboard test set.]]></description>

Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) increasingly rely on visual chain-of-thought to perform region-grounded reasoning over images. However, existing approaches ground regions via either textified coordinates-causing modality mismatch and semantic fragmentation or fixed-granularity patches that both limit precise region selection and often require non-trivial architectural changes. In this paper, we propose Numerical Visual Chain-of-Thought (NV-CoT), a framework that enables MLLMs to reason over images using continuous numerical coordinates. NV-CoT expands the MLLM action space from discrete vocabulary tokens to a continuous Euclidean space, allowing models to directly generate bounding-box coordinates as actions with only minimal architectural modification. The framework supports both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. In particular, we replace categorical token policies with a Gaussian (or Laplace) policy over coordinates and introduce stochasticity via reparameterized sampling, making NV-CoT fully compatible with GRPO-style policy optimization. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks against eight representative visual reasoning baselines demonstrate that NV-CoT significantly improves localization precision and final answer accuracy, while also accelerating training convergence, validating the effectiveness of continuous-action visual reasoning in MLLMs. The code is available in https://github.com/kesenzhao/NV-CoT.]]></description>

Recent advances in text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-fidelity and temporally coherent videos synthesis. However, current models are predominantly optimized for single-event generation. When handling multi-event prompts, without explicit temporal grounding, such models often produce blended or collapsed scenes that break the intended narrative. To address this limitation, we present SwitchCraft, a training-free framework for multi-event video generation. Our key insight is that uniform prompt injection across time ignores the correspondence between events and frames. To this end, we introduce Event-Aligned Query Steering (EAQS), which steers frame-level attention to align with relevant event prompts. Furthermore, we propose Auto-Balance Strength Solver (ABSS), which adaptively balances steering strength to preserve temporal consistency and visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SwitchCraft substantially improves prompt alignment, event clarity, and scene consistency compared with existing baselines, offering a simple yet effective solution for multi-event video generation.]]></description>

Occlusion remains a critical challenge in robotic fruit harvesting, as undetected or inaccurately localised fruits often results in substantial crop losses. To mitigate this issue, we propose a harvesting framework using a new amodal segmentation model, GDA-YOLO11, which incorporates architectural improvements and an updated asymmetric mask loss. The proposed model is trained on a modified version of a public citrus dataset and evaluated on both the base dataset and occlusion-sensitive subsets with varying occlusion levels. Within the framework, full fruit masks, including invisible regions, are inferred by GDA-YOLO11, and picking points are subsequently estimated using the Euclidean distance transform. These points are then projected into 3D coordinates for robotic harvesting execution. Experiments were conducted using real citrus fruits in a controlled environment simulating occlusion scenarios. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first practical demonstration of amodal instance segmentation in robotic fruit harvesting. GDA-YOLO11 achieves a precision of 0.844, recall of 0.846, mAP@50 of 0.914, and mAP@50:95 of 0.636, outperforming YOLO11n by 5.1%, 1.3%, and 1.0% in precision, mAP@50, and mAP@50:95, respectively. The framework attains harvesting success rates of 92.59%, 85.18%, 48.14%, and 22.22% at zero to high occlusion levels, improving success by 3.5% under medium and high occlusion. These findings demonstrate that GDA-YOLO11 enhances occlusion robust segmentation and streamlines perception-to-action integration, paving the way for more reliable autonomous systems in agriculture.]]></description>

Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) demonstrates significant potential for handling knowledge-intensive tasks. However, conflicts arise between static parametric knowledge in vision language models (VLMs) and dynamically retrieved information due to the static model knowledge from pre-training. The outputs either ignore retrieved contexts or exhibit inconsistent integration with parametric knowledge, posing substantial challenges for KB-VQA. Current knowledge conflict mitigation methods primarily adapted from language-based approaches, focusing on context-level conflicts through engineered prompting strategies or context-aware decoding mechanisms. However, these methods neglect the critical role of visual information in conflicts and suffer from redundant retrieved contexts, which impair accurate conflict identification and effective mitigation. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{CC-VQA}: a novel training-free, conflict- and correlation-aware method for KB-VQA. Our method comprises two core components: (1) Vision-Centric Contextual Conflict Reasoning, which performs visual-semantic conflict analysis across internal and external knowledge contexts; and (2) Correlation-Guided Encoding and Decoding, featuring positional encoding compression for low-correlation statements and adaptive decoding using correlation-weighted conflict scoring. Extensive evaluations on E-VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA benchmarks demonstrate that CC-VQA achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding absolute accuracy improvements of 3.3\% to 6.4\% compared to existing methods.

Reconstructing 3D humans from images captured at multiple perspectives typically requires pre-calibration, like using checkerboards or MVS algorithms, which limits scalability and applicability in diverse real-world scenarios. In this work, we present \textbf{AHAP} (Reconstructing \textbf{A}rbitrary \textbf{H}umans from \textbf{A}rbitrary \textbf{P}erspectives), a feed-forward framework for reconstructing arbitrary humans from arbitrary camera perspectives without requiring camera calibration. Our core lies in the effective fusion of multi-view geometry to assist human association, reconstruction and localization. Specifically, we use a Cross-View Identity Association module through learnable person queries and soft assignment, supervised by contrastive learning to resolve cross-view human identity association. A Human Head fuses cross-view features and scene context for SMPL prediction, guided by cross-view reprojection losses to enforce body pose consistency. Additionally, multi-view geometry eliminates the depth ambiguity inherent in monocular methods, providing more precise 3D human localization through multi-view triangulation. Experiments on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D demonstrate that AHAP achieves competitive performance on both world-space human reconstruction and camera pose estimation, while being 180$\times$ faster than optimization-based approaches.]]></description>

Micro-expressions, characterized by transience and subtlety, pose challenges to existing optical flow-based recognition methods. To address this, this paper proposes a dual-branch micro-expression feature extraction network integrated with parallel attention. Key contributions include: 1) a residual network designed to alleviate gradient anishing and network degradation; 2) an Inception network constructed to enhance model representation and suppress interference from irrelevant regions; 3) an adaptive feature fusion module developed to integrate dual-branch features. Experiments on the CASME II dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 74.67% accuracy, outperforming LBP-TOP (by 11.26%), MSMMT (by 3.36%), and other comparative methods.]]></description>

Agentic search has emerged as a promising paradigm for adaptive retrieval systems powered by large language models (LLMs). However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on quality, overlooking efficiency factors that are critical for real-world deployment. Moreover, real-world user queries often contain underspecified preferences, a challenge that remains largely underexplored in current agentic search evaluation. As a result, many agentic search systems remain impractical despite their impressive performance. In this work, we introduce HotelQuEST, a benchmark comprising 214 hotel search queries that range from simple factual requests to complex queries, enabling evaluation across the full spectrum of query difficulty. We further address the challenge of evaluating underspecified user preferences by collecting clarifications that make annotators' implicit preferences explicit for evaluation. We find that LLM-based agents achieve higher accuracy than traditional retrievers, but at substantially higher costs due to redundant tool calls and suboptimal routing that fails to match query complexity to model capability. Our analysis exposes inefficiencies in current agentic search systems and demonstrates substantial potential for cost-aware optimization.]]></description>

Modern deep neural networks remain challenging to interpret due to the opacity of their latent representations, impeding model understanding, debugging, and debiasing. Concept Embedding Models (CEMs) address this by mapping inputs to human-interpretable concept representations from which tasks can be predicted. Yet, CEMs fail to represent inter-concept relationships and require concept annotations at different granularities during training, limiting their applicability. In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical Concept Embedding Models (HiCEMs), a new family of CEMs that explicitly model concept relationships through hierarchical structures. To enable HiCEMs in real-world settings, we propose Concept Splitting, a method for automatically discovering finer-grained sub-concepts from a pretrained CEM's embedding space without requiring additional annotations. This allows HiCEMs to generate fine-grained explanations from limited concept labels, reducing annotation burdens. Our evaluation across multiple datasets, including a user study and experiments on PseudoKitchens, a newly proposed concept-based dataset of 3D kitchen renders, demonstrates that (1) Concept Splitting discovers human-interpretable sub-concepts absent during training that can be used to train highly accurate HiCEMs, and (2) HiCEMs enable powerful test-time concept interventions at different granularities, leading to improved task accuracy.]]></description>

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate proficiency in 2D scenes, extending their perceptual intelligence to 3D point cloud understanding remains a significant challenge. Current approaches focus primarily on aligning 3D features with pre-trained models. However, they typically treat geometric reasoning as an implicit mapping process. These methods bypass intermediate logical steps and consequently suffer from geometric hallucinations. They confidently generate plausible responses that fail to ground in precise structural details. To bridge this gap, we present PointCoT, a novel framework that empowers MLLMs with explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for 3D data. We advocate for a \textit{Look, Think, then Answer} paradigm. In this approach, the model is supervised to generate geometry-grounded rationales before predicting final answers. To facilitate this, we construct Point-Reason-Instruct, a large-scale benchmark comprising $\sim$86k instruction-tuning samples with hierarchical CoT annotations. By leveraging a dual-stream multi-modal architecture, our method synergizes semantic appearance with geometric truth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointCoT achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex reasoning tasks.]]></description>

Memory systems address the challenge of context loss in Large Language Model during prolonged interactions. However, compared to human cognition, the efficacy of these systems in processing emotion-related information remains inconclusive. To address this gap, we propose an emotion-enhanced memory evaluation benchmark to assess the performance of mainstream and state-of-the-art memory systems in handling affective information. We developed the \textbf{H}uman-\textbf{L}ike \textbf{M}emory \textbf{E}motion (\textbf{HLME}) dataset, which evaluates memory systems across three dimensions: emotional information extraction, emotional memory updating, and emotional memory question answering. Experimental results indicate that none of the evaluated systems achieve robust performance across all three tasks. Our findings provide an objective perspective on the current deficiencies of memory systems in processing emotional memories and suggest a new trajectory for future research and system optimization.]]></description>

This paper introduces a dataset of enriched geographic coordinates retrieved from Diderot and d'Alembert's eighteenth-century Encyclopedie. Automatically recovering geographic coordinates from historical texts is a complex task, as they are expressed in a variety of ways and with varying levels of precision. To improve retrieval of coordinates from similar digitized early modern texts, we have created a gold standard dataset, trained models, published the resulting inferred and normalized coordinate data, and experimented applying these models to new texts. From 74,000 total articles in each of the digitized versions of the Encyclopedie from ARTFL and ENCCRE, we examined 15,278 geographical entries, manually identifying 4,798 containing coordinates, and 10,480 with descriptive but non-numerical references. Leveraging our gold standard annotations, we trained transformer-based models to retrieve and normalize coordinates. The pipeline presented here combines a classifier to identify coordinate-bearing entries and a second model for retrieval, tested across encoder-decoder and decoder architectures. Cross-validation yielded an 86% EM score. On an out-of-domain eighteenth-century Trevoux dictionary (also in French), our fine-tuned model had a 61% EM score, while for the nineteenth-century, 7th edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica in English, the EM was 77%. These findings highlight the gold standard dataset's usefulness as training data, and our two-step method's cross-lingual, cross-domain generalizability.]]></description>

Transformer-based models such as BERT have significantly advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) across many languages. However, Nepali, a low-resource language written in Devanagari script, remains relatively underexplored. This study benchmarks multilingual, Indic, Hindi, and Nepali BERT variants to evaluate their effectiveness in Nepali topic classification. Ten pre-trained models, including mBERT, XLM-R, MuRIL, DevBERT, HindiBERT, IndicBERT, and NepBERTa, were fine-tuned and tested on the balanced Nepali dataset containing 25,006 sentences across five conceptual domains and the performance was evaluated using accuracy, weighted precision, recall, F1-score, and AUROC metrics. The results reveal that Indic models, particularly MuRIL-large, achieved the highest F1-score of 90.60%, outperforming multilingual and monolingual models. NepBERTa also performed competitively with an F1-score of 88.26%. Overall, these findings establish a robust baseline for future document-level classification and broader Nepali NLP applications.]]></description>

Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) agents often struggle with long-horizon reasoning in unseen environments, particularly when facing ambiguous, coarse-grained instructions. While recent advances use knowledge graph to enhance reasoning, the potential of multimodal event knowledge inspired by human episodic memory remains underexplored. In this work, we propose an event-centric knowledge enhancement strategy for automated process knowledge mining and feature fusion to solve coarse-grained instruction and long-horizon reasoning in VLN task. First, we construct YE-KG, the first large-scale multimodal spatiotemporal knowledge graph, with over 86k nodes and 83k edges, derived from real-world indoor videos. By leveraging multimodal large language models (i.e., LLaVa, GPT4), we extract unstructured video streams into structured semantic-action-effect events to serve as explicit episodic memory. Second, we introduce STE-VLN, which integrates the above graph into VLN models via a Coarse-to-Fine Hierarchical Retrieval mechanism. This allows agents to retrieve causal event sequences and dynamically fuse them with egocentric visual observations. Experiments on REVERIE, R2R, and R2R-CE benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency of our event-centric strategy, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches across diverse action spaces. Our data and code are available on the project website https://sites.google.com/view/y-event-kg/.]]></description>

Serverless computing simplifies cloud deployment but introduces new challenges in managing service latency and carbon emissions. Reducing cold-start latency requires retaining warm function instances, while minimizing carbon emissions favors reclaiming idle resources. This balance is further complicated by time-varying grid carbon intensity and varying workload patterns, under which static keep-alive policies are inefficient. We present LACE-RL, a latency-aware and carbon-efficient management framework that formulates serverless pod retention as a sequential decision problem. LACE-RL uses deep reinforcement learning to dynamically tune keep-alive durations, jointly modeling cold-start probability, function-specific latency costs, and real-time carbon intensity. Using the Huawei Public Cloud Trace, we show that LACE-RL reduces cold starts by 51.69% and idle keep-alive carbon emissions by 77.08% compared to Huawei's static policy, while achieving better latency-carbon trade-offs than state-of-the-art heuristic and single-objective baselines, approaching Oracle performance.]]></description>

This paper presents a novel autonomous robotic assembly framework for constructing stable structures without relying on predefined architectural blueprints. Instead of following fixed plans, construction tasks are defined through targets and obstacles, allowing the system to adapt more flexibly to environmental uncertainty and variations during the building process. A reinforcement learning (RL) policy, trained using deep Q-learning with successor features, serves as the decision-making component. As a proof of concept, we evaluate the approach on a benchmark of 15 2D robotic assembly tasks of discrete block construction. Experiments using a real-world closed-loop robotic setup demonstrate the feasibility of the method and its ability to handle construction noise. The results suggest that our framework offers a promising direction for more adaptable and robust robotic construction in real-world environments.]]></description>

We show that large language models (LLMs) have an astonishing ability to recover meaning from severely degraded English texts. Texts in which content words have been randomly substituted by nonsense strings, e.g., "At the ghybe of the swuint, we are haiveed to Wourge Phrear-gwurr, who sproles into an ghitch flount with his crurp", can be translated to conventional English that is, in many cases, close to the original text, e.g., "At the start of the story, we meet a man, Chow, who moves into an apartment building with his wife." These results show that structural cues (e.g., morphosyntax, closed-class words) constrain lexical meaning to a much larger degree than imagined. Although the abilities of LLMs to make sense of "Jabberwockified" English are clearly superhuman, they are highly relevant to understanding linguistic structure and suggest that efficient language processing either in biological or artificial systems likely benefits from very tight integration between syntax, lexical semantics, and general world knowledge.]]></description>

Neural implicit surface reconstruction with signed distance function has made significant progress, but recovering fine details such as thin structures and complex geometries remains challenging due to unreliable or noisy geometric priors. Existing approaches rely on implicit uncertainty that arises during optimization to filter these priors, which is indirect and inefficient, and masking supervision in high-uncertainty regions further leads to under-constrained optimization. To address these issues, we propose GPU-SDF, a neural implicit framework for indoor surface reconstruction that leverages geometric prior uncertainty and complementary constraints. We introduce a self-supervised module that explicitly estimates prior uncertainty without auxiliary networks. Based on this estimation, we design an uncertainty-guided loss that modulates prior influence rather than discarding it, thereby retaining weak but informative cues. To address regions with high prior uncertainty, GPU-SDF further incorporates two complementary constraints: an edge distance field that strengthens boundary supervision and a multi-view consistency regularization that enforces geometric coherence. Extensive experiments confirm that GPU-SDF improves the reconstruction of fine details and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement for existing frameworks.

The advent of large-scale self-supervised learning (SSL) has produced a vast zoo of medical foundation models. However, selecting optimal medical foundation models for specific segmentation tasks remains a computational bottleneck. Existing Transferability Estimation (TE) metrics, primarily designed for classification, rely on global statistical assumptions and fail to capture the topological complexity essential for dense prediction. We propose a novel Topology-Driven Transferability Estimation framework that evaluates manifold tractability rather than statistical overlap. Our approach introduces three components: (1) Global Representation Topology Divergence (GRTD), utilizing Minimum Spanning Trees to quantify feature-label structural isomorphism; (2) Local Boundary-Aware Topological Consistency (LBTC), which assesses manifold separability specifically at critical anatomical boundaries; and (3) Task-Adaptive Fusion, which dynamically integrates global and local metrics based on the semantic cardinality of the target task. Validated on the large-scale OpenMind benchmark across diverse anatomical targets and SSL foundation models, our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by around \textbf{31\%} relative improvement in the weighted Kendall, providing a robust, training-free proxy for efficient model selection without the cost of fine-tuning. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.]]></description>

When a text description is extended with an additional detail, image-text similarity should drop if that detail is wrong. We show that CLIP-style dual encoders often violate this intuition: appending a plausible but incorrect object or relation to an otherwise correct description can increase the similarity score. We call such cases half-truths. On COCO, CLIP prefers the correct shorter description only 40.6% of the time, and performance drops to 32.9% when the added detail is a relation. We trace this vulnerability to weak supervision on caption parts: contrastive training aligns full sentences but does not explicitly enforce that individual entities and relations are grounded. We propose CS-CLIP (Component-Supervised CLIP), which decomposes captions into entity and relation units, constructs a minimally edited foil for each unit, and fine-tunes the model to score the correct unit above its foil while preserving standard dual-encoder inference. CS-CLIP raises half-truth accuracy to 69.3% and improves average performance on established compositional benchmarks by 5.7 points, suggesting that reducing half-truth errors aligns with broader gains in compositional understanding.

State-of-the-art models for medical image segmentation achieve excellent accuracy but require substantial computational resources, limiting deployment in resource-constrained clinical settings. We present SegMate, an efficient 2.5D framework that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while considerably reducing computational requirements. Our efficient design is the result of meticulously integrating asymmetric architectures, attention mechanisms, multi-scale feature fusion, slice-based positional conditioning, and multi-task optimization. We demonstrate the efficiency-accuracy trade-off of our framework across three modern backbones (EfficientNetV2-M, MambaOut-Tiny, FastViT-T12). We perform experiments on three datasets: TotalSegmentator, SegTHOR and AMOS22. Compared with the vanilla models, SegMate reduces computation (GFLOPs) by up to 2.5x and memory footprint (VRAM) by up to 2.1x, while generally registering performance gains of around 1%. On TotalSegmentator, we achieve a Dice score of 93.51% with only 295MB peak GPU memory. Zero-shot cross-dataset evaluations on SegTHOR and AMOS22 demonstrate strong generalization, with Dice scores of up to 86.85% and 89.35%, respectively. We release our open-source code at https://github.com/andreibunea99/SegMate.]]></description>

Robotic manipulation requires policies that are smooth and responsive to evolving observations. However, synchronous inference in the raw action space introduces several challenges, including intra-chunk jitter, inter-chunk discontinuities, and stop-and-go execution. These issues undermine a policy's smoothness and its responsiveness to environmental changes. We propose ABPolicy, an asynchronous flow-matching policy that operates in a B-spline control-point action space. First, the B-spline representation ensures intra-chunk smoothness. Second, we introduce bidirectional action prediction coupled with refitting optimization to enforce inter-chunk continuity. Finally, by leveraging asynchronous inference, ABPolicy delivers real-time, continuous updates. We evaluate ABPolicy across seven tasks encompassing both static settings and dynamic settings with moving objects. Empirical results indicate that ABPolicy reduces trajectory jerk, leading to smoother motion and improved performance. Project website: https://teee000.github.io/ABPolicy/.]]></description>

We propose an experience-guided cascaded multi-agent framework for Breast Ultrasound Screening and Diagnosis, called BUSD-Agent, that aims to reduce diagnostic escalation and unnecessary biopsy referrals. Our framework models screening and diagnosis as a two-stage, selective decision-making process. A lightweight `screening clinic' agent, restricted to classification models as tools, selectively filters out benign and normal cases from further diagnostic escalation when malignancy risk and uncertainty are estimated as low. Cases that have higher risks are escalated to the `diagnostic clinic' agent, which integrates richer perception and radiological description tools to make a secondary decision on biopsy referral. To improve agent performance, past records of pathology-confirmed outcomes along with image embeddings, model predictions, and historical agent actions are stored in a memory bank as structured decision trajectories. For each new case, BUSD-Agent retrieves similar past cases based on image, model response and confidence similarity to condition the agent's current decision policy. This enables retrieval-conditioned in-context adaptation that dynamically adjusts model trust and escalation thresholds from prior experiences without parameter updates. Evaluation across 10 breast ultrasound datasets shows that the proposed experience-guided workflow reduces diagnostic escalation in BUSD-Agent from 84.95% to 58.72% and overall biopsy referrals from 59.50% to 37.08%, compared to the same architecture without trajectory conditioning, while improving average screening specificity by 68.48% and diagnostic specificity by 6.33%.]]></description>

Estimating 3D occupancy and motion at the vehicle's surroundings is essential for autonomous driving, enabling situational awareness in dynamic environments. Existing approaches jointly learn geometry and motion but rely on expensive 3D occupancy and flow annotations, velocity labels from bounding boxes, or pretrained optical flow models. We propose a self-supervised method for 3D occupancy flow estimation that eliminates the need for human-produced annotations or external flow supervision. Our method disentangles the scene into separate static and dynamic signed distance fields and learns motion implicitly through temporal aggregation. Additionally, we introduce a strong self-supervised flow cue derived from features' cosine similarities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our 3D occupancy flow method on SemanticKITTI, KITTI-MOT, and nuScenes.]]></description>

Embodied foundation models require large-scale, high-quality real-world interaction data for pre-training and scaling. However, existing data collection methods suffer from high infrastructure costs, complex hardware dependencies, and limited interaction scope, making scalable expansion challenging. In fact, humans themselves are ideal physically embodied agents. Therefore, obtaining egocentric real-world interaction data from globally distributed "human agents" offers advantages of low cost and sustainability. To this end, we propose the Always-on Egocentric (AoE) data collection system, which aims to simplify hardware dependencies by leveraging humans themselves and their smartphones, enabling low-cost, highly efficient, and scene-agnostic real-world interaction data collection to address the challenge of data scarcity. Specifically, we first employ an ergonomic neck-mounted smartphone holder to enable low-barrier, large-scale egocentric data collection through a cloud-edge collaborative architecture. Second, we develop a cross-platform mobile APP that leverages on-device compute for real-time processing, while the cloud hosts automated labeling and filtering pipelines that transform raw videos into high-quality training data. Finally, the AoE system supports distributed Ego video data collection by anyone, anytime, and anywhere. We evaluate AoE on data preprocessing quality and downstream tasks, demonstrating that high-quality egocentric data significantly boosts real-world generalization.]]></description>

Multimodal large models have shown excellent ability in addressing image super-resolution in real-world scenarios by leveraging language class as condition information, yet their abilities in degraded images remain limited. In this paper, we first revisit the capabilities of the Recognize Anything Model (RAM) for degraded images by calculating text similarity. We find that directly using contrastive learning to fine-tune RAM in the degraded space is difficult to achieve acceptable results. To address this issue, we employ a degradation selection strategy to propose a Real Embedding Extractor (REE), which achieves significant recognition performance gain on degraded image content through contrastive learning. Furthermore, we use a Conditional Feature Modulator (CFM) to incorporate the high-level information of REE for a powerful Mamba-based network, which can leverage effective pixel information to restore image textures and produce visually pleasing results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the REE can effectively help image super-resolution networks balance fidelity and perceptual quality, highlighting the great potential of Mamba in real-world applications.

Personal care formulations often contain synthetic and non-biodegradable ingredients, such as silicone and mineral oils, which can offer a unique performance. However, due to regulations like the EU ban of Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4), Decamethyl-cyclopentasiloxane (D5), Dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane (D6) already in effect for rinse off and for leave on cosmetics by June 2027 coupled with growing consumer awareness and expectations on sustainability, personal care brands face significant pressure to replace these synthetic ingredients with natural alternatives without compromising performance and cost. As a result, formulators are confronted with the challenge to find natural-based solutions within a short timeframe. In this study, we propose a pioneering approach that utilizes predicting modelling and simulation-based digital services to obtain natural-based ingredient combinations as recommendations to commonly used synthetic ingredients. We will demonstrate the effectiveness of our predictions through the application of these proposals in specific formulations. By offering a platform of digital services, it is aimed to empower formulators to explore good performing novel and environmentally friendly alternatives, ultimately driving a substantial and genuine transformation in the personal care industry.]]></description>

Speculative decoding accelerates autoregressive large language model (LLM) inference by using a lightweight draft model to propose candidate tokens that are then verified in parallel by the target model. The speedup is significantly determined by the acceptance rate, yet standard training minimizes Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as a proxy objective. While KL divergence and acceptance rate share the same global optimum, small draft models, having limited capacity, typically converge to suboptimal solutions where minimizing KL does not guarantee maximizing acceptance rate. To address this issue, we propose LK losses, special training objectives that directly target acceptance rate. Comprehensive experiments across four draft architectures and six target models, ranging from 8B to 685B parameters, demonstrate consistent improvements in acceptance metrics across all configurations compared to the standard KL-based training. We evaluate our approach on general, coding and math domains and report gains of up to 8-10% in average acceptance length. LK losses are easy to implement, introduce no computational overhead and can be directly integrated into any existing speculator training framework, making them a compelling alternative to the existing draft training objectives.]]></description>

This paper develops a theory of graph classification under domain shift through a random-graph generative lens, where we consider intra-class graphs sharing the same random graph model (RGM) and the domain shift induced by changes in RGM components. While classic domain adaptation (DA) theories have well-underpinned existing techniques to handle graph distribution shift, the information of graph samples, which are itself structured objects, is less explored. The non-Euclidean nature of graphs and specialized architectures for graph learning further complicate a fine-grained analysis of graph distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose a theory that assumes RGM as the data generative process, exploiting its connection to hypothesis complexity in function space perspective for such fine-grained analysis. Building on a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (vRKHS) formulation, we derive a generalization bound whose shift penalty admits a factorization into (i) a domain discrepancy term, (ii) a spectral-geometry term summarized by the accessible truncated spectrum, and (iii) an amplitude term that aggregates convergence and construction-stability effects. We empirically verify the insights on these terms in both real data and simulations.]]></description>

Designing efficient reward functions for low-level control tasks is a challenging problem. Recent research aims to reduce reliance on expert experience by using Large Language Models (LLMs) with task information to generate dense reward functions. These methods typically rely on training results as feedback, iteratively generating new reward functions with greedy or evolutionary algorithms. However, they suffer from poor utilization of historical feedback and inefficient search, resulting in limited improvements in complex control tasks. To address this challenge, we propose RF-Agent, a framework that treats LLMs as language agents and frames reward function design as a sequential decision-making process, enhancing optimization through better contextual reasoning. RF-Agent integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to manage the reward design and optimization process, leveraging the multi-stage contextual reasoning ability of LLMs. This approach better utilizes historical information and improves search efficiency to identify promising reward functions. Outstanding experimental results in 17 diverse low-level control tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Cross-domain intrusion detection remains a critical challenge due to significant variability in network traffic characteristics and feature distributions across environments. This study evaluates the transferability of three widely used flow-based feature sets (Argus, Zeek and CICFlowMeter) across four widely used datasets representing heterogeneous IoT and Industrial IoT network conditions. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate in- and cross-domain performance across multiple classification models and analyze feature importance using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Our results show that models trained on one domain suffer significant performance degradation when applied to a different target domain, reflecting the sensitivity of IoT intrusion detection systems to distribution shifts. Furthermore, the results evidence that the choice of classification algorithm and feature representations significantly impact transferability. Beyond reporting performance differences and thorough analysis of the transferability of features and feature spaces, we provide practical guidelines for feature engineering to improve robustness under domain variability. Our findings suggest that effective intrusion detection requires both high in-domain performance and resilience to cross-domain variability, achievable through careful feature space design, appropriate algorithm selection and adaptive strategies.]]></description>

To address the challenge of aerial visual place recognition (VPR) problem under significant altitude variations, this study proposes an altitude-adaptive VPR approach that integrates ground feature density analysis with image classification techniques. The proposed method estimates airborne platforms' relative altitude by analyzing the density of ground features in images, then applies relative altitude-based cropping to generate canonical query images, which are subsequently used in a classification-based VPR strategy for localization. Extensive experiments across diverse terrains and altitude conditions demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high accuracy and robustness in both altitude estimation and VPR under significant altitude changes. Compared to conventional methods relying on barometric altimeters or Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors, this solution requires no additional hardware and offers a plug-and-play solution for downstream applications, {making it suitable for small- and medium-sized airborne platforms operating in diverse environments, including rural and urban areas.} Under significant altitude variations, incorporating our relative altitude estimation module into the VPR retrieval pipeline boosts average R@1 and R@5 by 29.85\% and 60.20\%, respectively, compared with applying VPR retrieval alone. Furthermore, compared to traditional {Monocular Metric Depth Estimation (MMDE) methods}, the proposed method reduces the mean error by 202.1 m, yielding average additional improvements of 31.4\% in R@1 and 44\% in R@5. These results demonstrate that our method establishes a robust, vision-only framework for three-dimensional visual place recognition, offering a practical and scalable solution for accurate airborne platforms localization under large altitude variations and limited sensor availability.]]></description>

A key challenge for autonomous driving lies in maintaining real-time situational awareness regarding surrounding obstacles under strict latency constraints. The high processing requirements coupled with limited onboard computational resources can cause delay issues, particularly in complex urban settings. To address this, we propose leveraging Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to partially offload processing to the cloud, where compute resources are abundant, thus reducing overall latency. Our approach utilizes transformer-based models to fuse multi-camera sensor data into a comprehensive Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation, enabling accurate 360-degree 3D object detection. The computation is dynamically split between the vehicle and the cloud based on the number of layers processed locally and the quantization level of the features. To further reduce network load, we apply feature vector clipping and compression prior to transmission. In a real-world experimental evaluation, our hybrid strategy achieved a 72 \% reduction in end-to-end latency compared to a traditional onboard solution. To adapt to fluctuating network conditions, we introduce a dynamic optimization algorithm that selects the split point and quantization level to maximize detection accuracy while satisfying real-time latency constraints. Trace-based evaluation under realistic bandwidth variability shows that this adaptive approach improves accuracy by up to 20 \% over static parameterization with the same latency performance.]]></description>

In this paper, we propose ReSeg-CLIP, a new training-free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation method for remote sensing data. To compensate for the problems of vision language models, such as CLIP in semantic segmentation caused by inappropriate interactions within the self-attention layers, we introduce a hierarchical scheme utilizing masks generated by SAM to constrain the interactions at multiple scales. We also present a model composition approach that averages the parameters of multiple RS-specific CLIP variants, taking advantage of a new weighting scheme that evaluates representational quality using varying text prompts. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results across three RS benchmarks without additional training.]]></description>

Software engineering agents (SWE) are improving rapidly, with recent gains largely driven by reinforcement learning (RL). However, RL training is constrained by the scarcity of large-scale task collections with reproducible execution environments and reliable test suites. Although a growing number of benchmarks have emerged, datasets suitable for training remain limited in scale and diversity or often target a limited set of high-resource language ecosystems. We introduce SWE-rebench V2, a language-agnostic automated pipeline for harvesting executable real-world SWE tasks and constructing RL training environments at scale. The pipeline synthesizes repository-specific installation and test procedures via an interactive setup agent, and filters unsound instances using an ensemble of LLM judges, validated against human-verified SWE-bench annotations. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of 32,000+ tasks spanning 20 languages and 3,600+ repositories, with pre-built images for reproducible execution. To further scale training data, we additionally release 120,000+ tasks with installation instructions, fail-to-pass tests and rich metadata, where the problem statement is generated based on the original pull request description. We validate the collected instances through a diagnostic study that covers a subset of tasks in five programming languages across seven popular models, and provide instance-level metadata that flags common confounders such as overly restrictive tests and underspecified descriptions. We release the datasets, the collection and execution code, and associated artifacts to enable large-scale training of SWE agents across diverse languages and repositories.]]></description>

Multi-agent debate (MAD) systems leverage collective intelligence to enhance reasoning capabilities, yet existing approaches struggle to simultaneously optimize accuracy, consensus formation, and computational efficiency. Static topology methods lack adaptability to task complexity variations, while external LLM-based coordination risks introducing privileged knowledge that compromises debate neutrality. This work presents RUMAD (Reinforcement-Unifying Multi-Agent Debate), a novel framework that formulates dynamic communication topology control in MAD as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem.
  RUMAD employs a content-agnostic observation scheme that captures high-level debate dynamics avoiding access to raw agent reasoning content. RUMAD uses a multi-objective reward to model solution quality, cohesion and efficiency. A PPO-trained controller dynamically adjusts edge weights in the communication graph, while a dual-threshold mechanism enables fine-grained control over both agent activation and information visibility.
  Experimental evaluation across MMLU, GSM8K, and GPQA benchmarks demonstrates that RUMAD achieves substantial efficiency gains, reducing token costs by over 80\%, while still improving reasoning accuracy compared to single LLM model and multiple MAD baselines. Notably, RUMAD trained exclusively on MMLU exhibits robust zero-shot generalization to out-of-domain (OOD) tasks, indicating that the learned communication strategies capture task-independent principles of effective multi-agent coordination. These results establish RUMAD as a efficient and robust approach for deploying multi-agent reasoning application with practical resource constraints.]]></description>

With the aim of detecting AI-generated images and identifying the specific models responsible for their generation, we propose a multi-modal multi-task model. The model leverages pre-trained BERT and CLIP Vision encoders for text and image feature extraction, respectively, and employs cross-modal feature fusion with a tailored multi-task loss function. Additionally, a pseudo-labeling-based data augmentation strategy was utilized to expand the training dataset with high-confidence samples. The model achieved fifth place in both Tasks A and B of the `CT2: AI-Generated Image Detection' competition, with F1 scores of 83.16\% and 48.88\%, respectively. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and its potential for advancing AI-generated content detection in real-world scenarios.

This paper proposes a novel distributed semismooth Newton based augmented Lagrangian method for solving a class of optimization problems over networks, where the global objective is defined as the sum of locally held cost functions, and communication is restricted to neighboring agents. Specifically, we employ the augmented Lagrangian method to solve an equivalently reformulated constrained version of the original problem. Each resulting subproblem is solved inexactly via a distributed semismooth Newton method. By fully leveraging the structure of the generalized Hessian, a distributed accelerated proximal gradient method is proposed to compute the Newton direction efficiently, eliminating the need to communicate with full Hessian matrices. Theoretical results are also obtained to guarantee the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of our algorithm compared to state-of-the-art distributed algorithms.]]></description>

Automatic sleep stage scoring is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. Although deep learning models have advanced the field, many existing models are computationally demanding and designed for single-channel electroencephalography (EEG), limiting their practicality for multimodal polysomnography (PSG) data. To overcome this, we propose ULW-SleepNet, an ultra-lightweight multimodal sleep stage scoring framework that efficiently integrates information from multiple physiological signals. ULW-SleepNet incorporates a novel Dual-Stream Separable Convolution (DSSC) Block, depthwise separable convolutions, channel-wise parameter sharing, and global average pooling to reduce computational overhead while maintaining competitive accuracy. Evaluated on the Sleep-EDF-20 and Sleep-EDF-78 datasets, ULW-SleepNet achieves accuracies of 86.9% and 81.4%, respectively, with only 13.3K parameters and 7.89M FLOPs. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our model reduces parameters by up to 98.6% with only marginal performance loss, demonstrating its strong potential for real-time sleep monitoring on wearable and IoT devices. The source code for this study is publicly available at https://github.com/wzw999/ULW-SLEEPNET.]]></description>

Color polarization demosaicking (CPDM) aims to reconstruct full-resolution polarization images of four directions from the color-polarization filter array (CPFA) raw image. Due to the challenge of predicting numerous missing pixels and the scarcity of high-quality training data, existing network-based methods, despite effectively recovering scene intensity information, still exhibit significant errors in reconstructing polarization characteristics (degree of polarization, DOP, and angle of polarization, AOP). To address this problem, we introduce the image diffusion prior from text-to-image (T2I) models to overcome the performance bottleneck of network-based methods, with the additional diffusion prior compensating for limited representational capacity caused by restricted data distribution. To effectively leverage the diffusion prior, we explicitly model the polarization uncertainty during reconstruction and use uncertainty to guide the diffusion model in recovering high error regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method accurately recovers scene polarization characteristics with both high fidelity and strong visual perception.]]></description>

The rapid expansion of Industrial IoT (IIoT) systems has amplified security challenges, as heterogeneous devices and dynamic traffic patterns increase exposure to sophisticated and previously unseen cyberattacks. Traditional intrusion detection systems often struggle in such environments due to their reliance on extensive labeled data and limited ability to detect new threats. To address these challenges, we propose MI$^2$DAS, a multi-layer intrusion detection framework that integrates anomaly-based hierarchical traffic pooling, open-set recognition to distinguish between known and unknown attacks and incremental learning for adapting to novel attack types with minimal labeling. Experiments conducted on the Edge-IIoTset dataset demonstrate strong performance across all layers. In the first layer, GMM achieves superior normal-attack discrimination (accuracy = 0.953, TPR = 1.000). In open-set recognition, GMM attains a recall of 0.813 for known attacks, while LOF achieves 0.882 recall for unknown attacks. For fine-grained classification of known attacks, Random Forest achieves a macro-F1 of 0.941. Finally, the incremental learning module maintains robust performance when incorporation novel attack classes, achieving a macro-F1 of 0.8995. These results showcase MI$^2$DAS as an effective, scalable and adaptive framework for enhancing IIoT security against evolving threats.]]></description>

Chinese text correction has traditionally focused on spelling and grammar, while factual error correction is usually treated separately. However, in paragraph-level Chinese professional writing, linguistic (word/grammar/punctuation) and factual errors frequently co-occur and interact, making unified correction both necessary and challenging. This paper introduces CLFEC (Chinese Linguistic & Factual Error Correction), a new task for joint linguistic and factual correction. We construct a mixed, multi-domain Chinese professional writing dataset spanning current affairs, finance, law, and medicine. We then conduct a systematic study of LLM-based correction paradigms, from prompting to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agentic workflows. The analysis reveals practical challenges, including limited generalization of specialized correction models, the need for evidence grounding for factual repair, the difficulty of mixed-error paragraphs, and over-correction on clean inputs. Results further show that handling linguistic and factual Error within the same context outperform decoupled processes, and that agentic workflows can be effective with suitable backbone models. Overall, our dataset and empirical findings provide guidance for building reliable, fully automatic proofreading systems in industrial settings.]]></description>

Recent work applies Large Language Models (LLMs) to source-code vulnerability detection, but most evaluations still rely on random train-test splits that ignore time and overestimate real-world performance. In practice, detectors are deployed on evolving code bases and must recognise future vulnerabilities under temporal distribution shift. This paper investigates continual fine-tuning of a decoder-style language model (microsoft/phi-2 with LoRA) on a CVE-linked dataset spanning 2018-2024, organised into bi-monthly windows. We evaluate eight continual learning strategies, including window-only and cumulative training, replay-based baselines and regularisation-based variants. We propose Hybrid Class-Aware Selective Replay (Hybrid-CASR), a confidence-aware replay method for binary vulnerability classification that prioritises uncertain samples while maintaining a balanced ratio of VULNERABLE and FIXED functions in the replay buffer. On bi-monthly forward evaluation Hybrid-CASR achieves a Macro-F1 of 0.667, improving on the window-only baseline (0.651) by 0.016 with statistically significant gains ($p = 0.026$) and stronger backward retention (IBR@1 of 0.741). Hybrid-CASR also reduces training time per window by about 17 percent compared to the baseline, whereas cumulative training delivers only a minor F1 increase (0.661) at a 15.9-fold computational cost. Overall, the results show that selective replay with class balancing offers a practical accuracy-efficiency trade-off for LLM-based temporal vulnerability detection under continuous temporal drift.]]></description>

Automated identification of DICOM image series is essential for large-scale medical image analysis, quality control, protocol harmonization, and reliable downstream processing. However, DICOM series classification remains challenging due to heterogeneous slice content, variable series length, and entirely missing, incomplete or inconsistent DICOM metadata. We propose an end-to-end multimodal framework for DICOM series classification that jointly models image content and acquisition metadata while explicitly accounting for all these challenges. (i) Images and metadata are encoded with modality-aware modules and fused using a bi-directional cross-modal attention mechanism. (ii) Metadata is processed by a sparse, missingness-aware encoder based on learnable feature dictionaries and value-conditioned modulation. By design, the approach does not require any form of imputation. (iii) Variability in series length and image data dimensions is handled via a 2.5D visual encoder and attention operating on equidistantly sampled slices. We evaluate the proposed approach on the publicly available Duke Liver MRI dataset and a large multi-institutional in-house cohort, assessing both in-domain performance and out-of-domain generalization. Across all evaluation settings, the proposed method consistently outperforms relevant image only, metadata-only and multimodal 2D/3D baselines. The results demonstrate that explicitly modeling metadata sparsity and cross-modal interactions improves robustness for DICOM series classification.]]></description>

In federated learning (FL), multi-step local updates and data heterogeneity usually lead to sharper global minima, which degrades the performance of the global model. Popular FL algorithms integrate sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) into local training to address this issue. However, in the high data heterogeneity setting, the flatness in local training does not imply the flatness of the global model. Therefore, minimizing the sharpness of the local loss surfaces on the client data does not enable the effectiveness of SAM in FL to improve the generalization ability of the global model. We define the \textbf{flatness distance} to explain this phenomenon. By rethinking the SAM in FL and theoretically analyzing the \textbf{flatness distance}, we propose a novel \textbf{FedNSAM} algorithm that accelerates the SAM algorithm by introducing global Nesterov momentum into the local update to harmonize the consistency of global and local flatness. \textbf{FedNSAM} uses the global Nesterov momentum as the direction of local estimation of client global perturbations and extrapolation. Theoretically, we prove a tighter convergence bound than FedSAM by Nesterov extrapolation. Empirically, we conduct comprehensive experiments on CNN and Transformer models to verify the superior performance and efficiency of \textbf{FedNSAM}. The code is available at https://github.com/junkangLiu0/FedNSAM.]]></description>

We present GLUScope, an open-source tool for analyzing neurons in Transformer-based language models, intended for interpretability researchers. We focus on more recent models than previous tools do; specifically we consider gated activation functions such as SwiGLU. This introduces a new challenge: understanding positive activations is not enough. Instead, both the gate and the in activation of a neuron can be positive or negative, leading to four different possible sign combinations that in some cases have quite different functionalities. Accordingly, for any neuron, our tool shows text examples for each of the four sign combinations, and indicates how often each combination occurs. We describe examples of how our tool can lead to novel insights. A demo is available at https: //sjgerstner.github.io/gluscope.]]></description>

Longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) data are often left-censored, making diagnosis records incomplete and unreliable for determining disease onset. In contrast, outpatient prescriptions form renewal-based trajectories that provide a continuous signal of disease management. We propose a probabilistic framework to infer chronic treatment onset by modeling prescription dynamics as a renewal process and detecting transitions from sporadic to sustained therapy via change-point detection between a baseline Poisson (sporadic prescribing) regime and a regime-specific Weibull (sustained therapy) renewal model. Using a nationwide ePrescription dataset of 2.4 million individuals, we show that the approach yields more temporally plausible onset estimates than naive rule-based triggering, substantially reducing implausible early detections under strong left censoring. Detection performance varies across diseases and is strongly associated with prescription density, highlighting both the strengths and limits of treatment-based onset inference.]]></description>

Complex video reasoning, actually, relies excessively on fine-grained perception rather than on expert (e.g., Ph.D, Science)-level reasoning. Through extensive empirical observation, we have recognized the critical impact of perception. In particular, when perception ability is almost fixed, enhancing reasoning from Qwen3-8B to OpenAI-o3 yields only 0.7% performance improvement. Conversely, even minimal change in perception model scale (from 7B to 32B) boosts performance by 1.4%, indicating enhancing perception, rather than reasoning, is more critical to improve performance. Therefore, exploring how to enhance perception ability through reasoning without the need for expensive fine-grained annotation information is worthwhile. To achieve this goal, we specially propose APPO, the Attention-guided Perception Policy Optimization algorithm that leverages token-level dense rewards to improve model's fine-grained perception. The core idea behind APPO is to optimize those tokens from different responses that primarily focus on the same crucial video frame (called intra-group perception tokens). Experimental results on diverse video benchmarks and models with different scales (3/7B) demonstrate APPO consistently outperforms GRPO and DAPO (0.5%~4%). We hope our work provides a promising approach to effectively enhance model's perception abilities through reasoning in a low-cost manner, serving diverse scenarios and demands.]]></description>

With the rapid advancement of deep learning, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has become a key modality for ship detection. However, robust performance remains challenging in complex scenes, where clutter and speckle noise can induce false alarms and small targets are easily missed. To address these issues, we propose CPN-YOLO, a high-precision ship detection framework built upon YOLOv8 with three targeted improvements. First, we introduce a learnable large-kernel denoising module for input pre-processing, producing cleaner representations and more discriminative features across diverse ship types. Second, we design a feature extraction enhancement strategy based on the PPA attention mechanism to strengthen multi-scale modeling and improve sensitivity to small ships. Third, we incorporate a Gaussian similarity loss derived from the normalized Wasserstein distance (NWD) to better measure similarity under complex bounding-box distributions and improve generalization. Extensive experiments on HRSID and SSDD demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On SSDD, CPN-YOLO surpasses the YOLOv8 baseline, achieving 97.0% precision, 95.1% recall, and 98.9% mAP, and consistently outperforms other representative deep-learning detectors in overall performance.]]></description>

Rapid progress in vision-language modeling has enabled pathology report generation from gigapixel whole-slide images, but most approaches assume static training with simultaneous access to all data. In clinical deployment, however, new organs, institutions, and reporting conventions emerge over time, and sequential fine-tuning can cause catastrophic forgetting. We introduce an exemplar-free continual learning framework for WSI-to-report generation that avoids storing raw slides or patch exemplars. The core idea is a compact domain footprint built in a frozen patch-embedding space: a small codebook of representative morphology tokens together with slide-level co-occurrence summaries and lightweight patch-count priors. These footprints support generative replay by synthesizing pseudo-WSI representations that reflect domain-specific morphological mixtures, while a teacher snapshot provides pseudo-reports to supervise the updated model without retaining past data. To address shifting reporting conventions, we distill domain-specific linguistic characteristics into a compact style descriptor and use it to steer generation. At inference, the model identifies the most compatible descriptor directly from the slide signal, enabling domain-agnostic setup without requiring explicit domain identifiers. Evaluated across multiple public continual learning benchmarks, our approach outperforms exemplar-free and limited-buffer rehearsal baselines, highlighting footprint-based generative replay as a practical solution for deployment in evolving clinical settings.]]></description>

Given a set of trajectories demonstrating the execution of a task safely in a constrained MDP with observable rewards but with unknown constraints and non-observable costs, we aim to find a policy that maximizes the likelihood of demonstrated trajectories trading the balance between being conservative and increasing significantly the likelihood of high-rewarding trajectories but with potentially unsafe steps. Having these objectives, we aim towards learning a policy that maximizes the probability of the most $promising$ trajectories with respect to the demonstrations. In so doing, we formulate the ``promise" of individual state-action pairs in terms of $Q$ values, which depend on task-specific rewards as well as on the assessment of states' safety, mixing expectations in terms of rewards and safety. This entails a safe Q-learning perspective of the inverse learning problem under constraints: The devised Safe $Q$ Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (SafeQIL) algorithm is compared to state-of-the art inverse constraint reinforcement learning algorithms to a set of challenging benchmark tasks, showing its merits.]]></description>

Bimanual manipulation requires policies that can reason about 3D geometry, anticipate how it evolves under action, and generate smooth, coordinated motions. However, existing methods typically rely on 2D features with limited spatial awareness, or require explicit point clouds that are difficult to obtain reliably in real-world settings. At the same time, recent 3D geometric foundation models show that accurate and diverse 3D structure can be reconstructed directly from RGB images in a fast and robust manner. We leverage this opportunity and propose a framework that builds bimanual manipulation directly on a pre-trained 3D geometric foundation model. Our policy fuses geometry-aware latents, 2D semantic features, and proprioception into a unified state representation, and uses diffusion model to jointly predict a future action chunk and a future 3D latent that decodes into a dense pointmap. By explicitly predicting how the 3D scene will evolve together with the action sequence, the policy gains strong spatial understanding and predictive capability using only RGB observations. We evaluate our method both in simulation on the RoboTwin benchmark and in real-world robot executions. Our approach consistently outperforms 2D-based and point-cloud-based baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance in manipulation success, inter-arm coordination, and 3D spatial prediction accuracy.

While prior works (e.g., Xie et al., 2021) have established the theoretical foundations of learning a good policy from offline data via pessimism, existing algorithms that are computationally tractable (often in an oracle-efficient sense), such as PSPI, only apply to finite and small action spaces. Moreover, these algorithms rely on state-wise mirror descent and require actors to be implicitly induced from the critic functions, failing to accommodate standalone policy parameterization which is ubiquitous in practice. In this work, we address these limitations and extend the theoretical guarantees to parameterized policy classes over large or continuous action spaces. When extending mirror descent to parameterized policies, we identify contextual coupling as the core difficulty, and show how connecting mirror descent to natural policy gradient leads to novel analyses, guarantees, and algorithmic insights, including a surprising unification between offline RL and imitation learning.]]></description>

Explaining opaque Machine Learning (ML) models has become an increasingly important challenge. However, current eXplanation in AI (XAI) methods suffer several shortcomings, including insufficient abstraction, limited user interactivity, and inadequate integration of symbolic knowledge. We propose ReasonX, an explanation tool based on expressions (or, queries) in a closed algebra of operators over theories of linear constraints. ReasonX provides declarative and interactive explanations for decision trees, which may represent the ML models under analysis or serve as global or local surrogate models for any black-box predictor. Users can express background or common sense knowledge as linear constraints. This allows for reasoning at multiple levels of abstraction, ranging from fully specified examples to under-specified or partially constrained ones. ReasonX leverages Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to reason over the features of factual and contrastive instances. We present here the architecture of ReasonX, which consists of a Python layer, closer to the user, and a Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) layer, which implements a meta-interpreter of the query algebra. The capabilities of ReasonX are demonstrated through qualitative examples, and compared to other XAI tools through quantitative experiments.]]></description>

Pre-trained perception models excel in generic image domains but degrade significantly in novel environments like indoor scenes. The conventional remedy is fine-tuning on downstream data which incurs catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge and demands costly, scene-specific annotations. We propose a paradigm shift through Sea$^2$ (See, Act, Adapt): rather than adapting the perception modules themselves, we adapt how they are deployed through an intelligent pose-control agent. Sea$^2$ keeps all perception modules frozen, requiring no downstream labels during training, and uses only scalar perceptual feedback to navigate the agent toward informative viewpoints. Specially, we transform a vision-language model (VLM) into a low-level pose controller through a two-stage training pipeline: first fine-tuning it on rule-based exploration trajectories that systematically probe indoor scenes, and then refining the policy via unsupervised reinforcement learning that constructs rewards from the perception module's outputs and confidence. Unlike prior active perception methods that couple exploration with specific models or collect data for retraining them, Sea$^2$ directly leverages off-the-shelf perception models for various tasks without the need for retraining. We conducted experiments on three visual perception tasks, including visual grounding, segmentation and 3D box estimation, with performance improvements of 13.54%, 15.92% and 27.68% respectively on dataset ReplicaCAD.]]></description>

Reinforcement learning (RL) actor-critic algorithms enable autonomous learning but often require a large number of environment interactions, which limits their applicability in robotics. Leveraging expert data can reduce the number of required environment interactions. A common approach is actor pretraining, where the actor network is initialized via behavioral cloning on expert demonstrations and subsequently fine-tuned with RL. In contrast, the initialization of the critic network has received little attention, despite its central role in policy optimization. This paper proposes a pretraining approach for actor-critic algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) that uses expert demonstrations to initialize both networks. The actor is pretrained via behavioral cloning, while the critic is pretrained using returns obtained from rollouts of the pretrained policy. The approach is evaluated on 15 simulated robotic manipulation and locomotion tasks. Experimental results show that actor-critic pretraining improves sample efficiency by 86.1% on average compared to no pretraining and by 30.9% to actor-only pretraining.]]></description>

Accurate segmentation of aortic dissection (AD) lumens in CT angiography (CTA) is essential for quantitative morphological assessment and clinical decision-making. However, reliable 3D delineation remains challenging due to limited long-range context modeling, which compromises inter-slice coherence, and insufficient structural discrimination under low-contrast conditions. To address these limitations, we propose BiM-GeoAttn-Net, a lightweight framework that integrates linear-time depth-wise state-space modeling with geometry-aware vessel refinement. Our approach is featured by Bidirectional Depth Mamba (BiM) to efficiently capture cross-slice dependencies and Geometry-Aware Vessel Attention (GeoAttn) module that employs orientation-sensitive anisotropic filtering to refine tubular structures and sharpen ambiguous boundaries. Extensive experiments on a multi-source AD CTA dataset demonstrate that BiM-GeoAttn-Net achieves a Dice score of 93.35% and an HD95 of 12.36 mm, outperforming representative CNN-, Transformer-, and SSM-based baselines in overlap metrics while maintaining competitive boundary accuracy. These results suggest that coupling linear-time depth modeling with geometry-aware refinement provides an effective, computationally efficient solution for robust 3D AD segmentation.]]></description>

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual reasoning and understanding tasks but still struggle to capture the complexity and subjectivity of human emotions. Existing approaches based on supervised fine-tuning often suffer from limited generalization and poor interpretability, while reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization fail to align with the intrinsic characteristics of emotional cognition. To address these challenges, we propose Reflective Reinforcement Learning for Emotional Reasoning (EMO-R3), a framework designed to enhance the emotional reasoning ability of MLLMs. Specifically, we introduce Structured Emotional Thinking to guide the model to perform step-by-step emotional reasoning in a structured and interpretable manner, and design a Reflective Emotional Reward that enables the model to re-evaluate its reasoning based on visual-text consistency and emotional coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EMO-R3 significantly improves both the interpretability and emotional intelligence of MLLMs, achieving superior performance across multiple visual emotional understanding benchmarks.]]></description>

Causal discovery has achieved substantial theoretical progress, yet its deployment in large-scale longitudinal systems remains limited. A key obstacle is that operational data are generated under institutional workflows whose induced partial orders are rarely formalized, enlarging the admissible graph space in ways inconsistent with the recording process. We characterize a workflow-induced constraint class for longitudinal causal discovery that restricts the admissible directed acyclic graph space through protocol-derived structural masks and timeline-aligned indexing. Rather than introducing a new optimization algorithm, we show that explicitly encoding workflow-consistent partial orders reduces structural ambiguity, especially in mixed discrete--continuous panels where within-time orientation is weakly identified. The framework combines workflow-derived admissible-edge constraints, measurement-aligned time indexing and block structure, bootstrap-based uncertainty quantification for lagged total effects, and a dynamic representation supporting intervention queries. In a nationwide annual health screening cohort in Japan with 107,261 individuals and 429,044 person-years, workflow-constrained longitudinal LiNGAM yields temporally consistent within-time substructures and interpretable lagged total effects with explicit uncertainty. Sensitivity analyses using alternative exposure and body-composition definitions preserve the main qualitative patterns. We argue that formalizing workflow-derived constraint classes improves structural interpretability without relying on domain-specific edge specification, providing a reproducible bridge between operational workflows and longitudinal causal discovery under standard identifiability assumptions.]]></description>

Machine unlearning for large language models often faces a privacy dilemma in which strict constraints prohibit sharing either the server's parameters or the client's forget set. To address this dual non-disclosure constraint, we propose MPU, an algorithm-agnostic privacy-preserving Multiple Perturbed Copies Unlearning framework that primarily introduces two server-side modules: Pre-Process for randomized copy generation and Post-Process for update aggregation. In Pre-Process, the server distributes multiple perturbed and reparameterized model instances, allowing the client to execute unlearning locally on its private forget set without accessing the server's exact original parameters. After local unlearning, the server performs Post-Process by inverting the reparameterization and aggregating updates with a harmonic denoising procedure to alleviate the impact of perturbation. Experiments with seven unlearning algorithms show that MPU achieves comparable unlearning performance to noise-free baselines, with most algorithms' average degradation well below 1% under 10% noise, and can even outperform the noise-free baseline for some algorithms under 1% noise. Code is available at https://github.com/Tristan-SHU/MPU.]]></description>

Structured deep model compression methods are hardware-friendly and substantially reduce memory and inference costs. However, under aggressive compression, the resulting accuracy degradation often necessitates post-compression finetuning, which can be impractical due to missing labeled data or high training cost. We propose post-hoc blockwise compensation, called GRAIL, a simple zero-finetuning step applied after model compression that restores each block's input-output behavior using a small calibration set. The method summarizes hidden activations via a Gram matrix and applies ridge regression to linearly reconstruct the original hidden representation from the reduced one. The resulting reconstruction map is absorbed into the downstream projection weights, while the upstream layer is compressed. The approach is selector-agnostic (Magnitude, Wanda, Gram-based selection, or folding), data-aware (requiring only a few forward passes without gradients or labels), and recovers classic pruning or folding when the Gram matrix is near identity, indicating weak inter-channel correlations. Across ResNets, ViTs, and decoder-only LLMs, GRAIL consistently improves accuracy or perplexity over data-free and data-aware pruning or folding baselines in practical compression regimes, with manageable overhead and no backpropagation. The code is available at https://github.com/TWWinde/GRAIL.]]></description>

Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have shown promising performance across various reasoning tasks, establishing themselves as an alternative to autoregressive large language models (LLMs). Unlike autoregressive LLMs that generate one token per step based on all previous tokens, dLLMs theoretically enable parallel generation of multiple tokens at each decoding step. However, recent dLLMs still favor one-token-per-step generation in practice, as directly decoding multiple masked tokens often leads to degraded generation quality and stability. This reveals a substantial gap between the theoretical parallelism and practical performance of dLLMs. To bridge this gap, we introduce an adaptive parallel decoding approach, namely DiCo, which features a three-phase divide-and-conquer paradigm to unleash the inherent parallelism of dLLMs. During the Divide phase, DiCo first explores the input masked sequence and identifies masked tokens as seed tokens, which are then expanded to construct a set of local clusters. During the Conquer phase, DiCo performs parallel decoding across different local clusters constructed in the Divide phase. The divide-and-conquer process repeatedly alternates between the Divide and Conquer phases until convergence. During the Finalize phase, DiCo decodes the remaining few masked tokens using an effective fine-grained compound decoding scheme to finalize the generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiCo can achieve significant inference speedups while maintaining competitive generation quality.]]></description>

Accurate focus quality assessment (FQA) in fluorescence microscopy remains challenging, as the stain-dependent optical properties of fluorescent dyes cause abrupt and heterogeneous focus shifts. However, existing datasets and models overlook this variability, treating focus quality as a stain-agnostic problem. In this work, we formulate the task of stain-aware FQA, emphasizing that focus behavior in fluorescence microscopy must be modeled as a function of staining characteristics. Through quantitative analysis of existing datasets (FocusPath, BBBC006) and our newly curated FluoMix, we demonstrate that focus-rank relationships vary substantially across stains, underscoring the need for stain-aware modeling in fluorescence microscopy. To support this new formulation, we propose FluoMix, the first dataset for stain-aware FQA that encompasses multiple tissues, fluorescent stains, and focus variations. Building on this dataset, we propose FluoCLIP, a two-stage vision-language framework that leverages CLIP's alignment capability to interpret focus quality in the context of biological staining. In the stain-grounding phase, FluoCLIP learns general stain representations by aligning textual stain tokens with visual features, while in the stain-guided ranking phase, it optimizes stain-specific rank prompts for ordinal focus prediction. Together, our formulation, dataset, and framework establish the first foundation for stain-aware FQA, and FluoCLIP achieves strong generalization across diverse fluorescence microscopy conditions.]]></description>

In remote sensing rotated object detection, mainstream methods suffer from two bottlenecks, directional incoherence at detector neck and task conflict at detecting head. Ulitising fourier rotation equivariance, we introduce Fourier Angle Alignment, which analyses angle information through frequency spectrum and aligns the main direction to a certain orientation. Then we propose two plug and play modules : FAAFusion and FAA Head. FAAFusion works at the detector neck, aligning the main direction of higher-level features to the lower-level features and then fusing them. FAA Head serves as a new detection head, which pre-aligns RoI features to a canonical angle and adds them to the original features before classification and regression. Experiments on DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and HRSC2016 show that our method can greatly improve previous work. Particularly, our method achieves new state-of-the-art results of 78.72% mAP on DOTA-v1.0 and 72.28% mAP on DOTA-v1.5 datasets with single scale training and testing, validating the efficacy of our approach in remote sensing object detection. The code is made publicly available at https://github.com/gcy0423/Fourier-Angle-Alignment .]]></description>

The performance of search algorithms for grid-based pathfinding, e.g. A*, critically depends on the heuristic function that is used to focus the search. Recent studies have shown that informed heuristics that take the positions/shapes of the obstacles into account can be approximated with the deep neural networks. Unfortunately, the existing learning-based approaches mostly rely on the assumption that training and test grid maps are drawn from the same distribution (e.g., city maps, indoor maps, etc.) and perform poorly on out-of-distribution tasks. This naturally limits their application in practice when often a universal solver is needed that is capable of efficiently handling any problem instance. In this work, we close this gap by designing an universal heuristic predictor: a model trained once, but capable of generalizing across a full spectrum of unseen tasks. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that the suggested approach halves the computational effort of A* by up to a factor of 2.2, while still providing solutions within 3% of the optimal cost on average altogether on the tasks that are completely different from the ones used for training $\unicode{x2013}$ a milestone reached for the first time by a learnable solver.]]></description>

We investigate the identifiability of nonlinear Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) in a multi-view setup, where each view is generated by an unknown nonlinear map applied to a linear mixture of shared latents and view-private noise. Rather than attempting exact unmixing, a problem proven to be ill-posed, we instead reframe multi-view CCA as a basis-invariant subspace identification problem. We prove that, under suitable latent priors and spectral separation conditions, multi-view CCA recovers the pairwise correlated signal subspaces up to view-wise orthogonal ambiguity. For $N \geq 3$ views, the objective provably isolates the jointly correlated subspaces shared across all views while eliminating view-private variations. We further establish finite-sample consistency guarantees by translating the concentration of empirical cross-covariances into explicit subspace error bounds via spectral perturbation theory. Experiments on synthetic and rendered image datasets validate our theoretical findings and confirm the necessity of the assumed conditions.]]></description>

Foundation models have transformed domains from language to genomics by learning general-purpose representations from large-scale, heterogeneous data. We introduce TradeFM, a 524M-parameter generative Transformer that brings this paradigm to market microstructure, learning directly from billions of trade events across >9K equities. To enable cross-asset generalization, we develop scale-invariant features and a universal tokenization scheme that map the heterogeneous, multi-modal event stream of order flow into a unified discrete sequence -- eliminating asset-specific calibration. Integrated with a deterministic market simulator, TradeFM-generated rollouts reproduce key stylized facts of financial returns, including heavy tails, volatility clustering, and absence of return autocorrelation. Quantitatively, TradeFM achieves 2-3x lower distributional error than Compound Hawkes baselines and generalizes zero-shot to geographically out-of-distribution APAC markets with moderate perplexity degradation. Together, these results suggest that scale-invariant trade representations capture transferable structure in market microstructure, opening a path toward synthetic data generation, stress testing, and learning-based trading agents.]]></description>

Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models lack an efficient mechanism for early quality assessment, leading to costly trial-and-error in multi-generation scenarios such as prompt iteration, agent-based generation, and flow-grpo. We reveal a strong correlation between early diffusion cross-attention distributions and final image quality. Based on this finding, we introduce Diffusion Probe, a framework that leverages internal cross-attention maps as predictive signals.
  We design a lightweight predictor that maps statistical properties of early-stage cross-attention extracted from initial denoising steps to the final image's overall quality. This enables accurate forecasting of image quality across diverse evaluation metrics long before full synthesis is complete.
  We validate Diffusion Probe across a wide range of settings. On multiple T2I models, across early denoising windows, resolutions, and quality metrics, it achieves strong correlation (PCC > 0.7) and high classification performance (AUC-ROC > 0.9).
  Its reliability translates into practical gains. By enabling early quality-aware decisions in workflows such as prompt optimization, seed selection, and accelerated RL training, the probe supports more targeted sampling and avoids computation on low-potential generations. This reduces computational overhead while improving final output quality.
  Diffusion Probe is model-agnostic, efficient, and broadly applicable, offering a practical solution for improving T2I generation efficiency through early quality prediction.]]></description>

State-of-the-art vessel segmentation methods typically require large-scale annotated datasets and suffer from severe performance degradation under domain shifts. In clinical practice, however, acquiring extensive annotations for every new scanner or protocol is unfeasible. To address this, we propose a novel framework leveraging a pre-trained Vision Foundation Model (DINOv3) adapted for volumetric vessel segmentation. We introduce a lightweight 3D Adapter for volumetric consistency, a multi-scale 3D Aggregator for hierarchical feature fusion, and Z-channel embedding to effectively bridge the gap between 2D pre-training and 3D medical modalities, enabling the model to capture continuous vascular structures from limited data. We validated our method on the TopCoW (in-domain) and Lausanne (out-of-distribution) datasets. In the extreme few-shot regime with 5 training samples, our method achieved a Dice score of 43.42%, marking a 30% relative improvement over the state-of-the-art nnU-Net (33.41%) and outperforming other Transformer-based baselines, such as SwinUNETR and UNETR, by up to 45%. Furthermore, in the out-of-distribution setting, our model demonstrated superior robustness, achieving a 50% relative improvement over nnU-Net (21.37% vs. 14.22%), which suffered from severe domain overfitting. Ablation studies confirmed that our 3D adaptation mechanism and multi-scale aggregation strategy are critical for vascular continuity and robustness. Our results suggest foundation models offer a viable cold-start solution, improving clinical reliability under data scarcity or domain shifts.]]></description>

This paper addresses the domain generalization (DG) problem in deep learning. While most DG methods focus on enforcing visual feature invariance, we leverage the reasoning capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and explore the potential of constructing reasoning chains that derives image categories to achieve more robust predictions under domain shift. To this end, we systematically study the role of reasoning in DG using DomainBed-Reasoning, a newly constructed extension of DomainBed dataset, in which each sample is paired with class-relevant reasoning chains. Our analysis reveals two key challenges: (i) fine-tuning MLLMs with reasoning chains for classification is more challenging than direct label supervision, since the model must optimize complex reasoning sequences before label prediction; and (ii) mismatches in reasoning patterns between supervision signals and fine-tuned MLLMs lead to a trade-off between semantic richness (informative but harder to optimize) and optimization efficiency (easier to optimize but less informative). To address these issues, we propose RD-MLDG (Reasoning-Driven Multimodal LLM for Domain Generalization), a framework with two components: (i) MTCT (Multi-Task Cross-Training), which introduces an additional direct classification pathway to guide reasoning supervision; and (ii) SARR (Self-Aligned Reasoning Regularization), which preserves the semantic richness of reasoning chains while mitigating reasoning-pattern mismatches via iterative self-labeling. Experiments on standard DomainBed datasets (PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraInc) demonstrate that RD-MLDG achieves state-of-the-art performances, highlighting reasoning as a promising complementary signal for robust out-of-domain generalization.]]></description>

Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables contact free monitoring of vital signs and is especially valuable for neonates, since conventional methods often require sustained skin contact with adhesive probes that can irritate fragile skin and increase infection control burden. We present VideoPulse, a neonatal dataset and an end to end pipeline that estimates neonatal heart rate and peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) from facial video. VideoPulse contains 157 recordings totaling 2.6 hours from 52 neonates with diverse face orientations. Our pipeline performs face alignment and artifact aware supervision using denoised pulse oximeter signals, then applies 3D CNN backbones for heart rate and SpO2 regression with label distribution smoothing and weighted regression for SpO2. Predictions are produced in 2 second windows. On the NBHR neonatal dataset, we obtain heart rate MAE 2.97 bpm using 2 second windows (2.80 bpm at 6 second windows) and SpO2 MAE 1.69 percent. Under cross dataset evaluation, the NBHR trained heart rate model attains 5.34 bpm MAE on VideoPulse, and fine tuning an NBHR pretrained SpO2 model on VideoPulse yields MAE 1.68 percent. These results indicate that short unaligned neonatal video segments can support accurate heart rate and SpO2 estimation, enabling low cost non invasive monitoring in neonatal intensive care.]]></description>

Generative models have gained significant traction in offline reinforcement learning (RL) due to their ability to model complex trajectory distributions. However, existing generation-based approaches still struggle with long-horizon tasks characterized by sparse rewards. Some hierarchical generation methods have been developed to mitigate this issue by decomposing the original problem into shorter-horizon subproblems using one policy and generating detailed actions with another. While effective, these methods often overlook the multi-scale temporal structure inherent in trajectories, resulting in suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose MAGE, a Multi-scale Autoregressive GEneration-based offline RL method. MAGE incorporates a condition-guided multi-scale autoencoder to learn hierarchical trajectory representations, along with a multi-scale transformer that autoregressively generates trajectory representations from coarse to fine temporal scales. MAGE effectively captures temporal dependencies of trajectories at multiple resolutions. Additionally, a condition-guided decoder is employed to exert precise control over short-term behaviors. Extensive experiments on five offline RL benchmarks against fifteen baseline algorithms show that MAGE successfully integrates multi-scale trajectory modeling with conditional guidance, generating coherent and controllable trajectories in long-horizon sparse-reward settings.]]></description>

Optical design is the process of configuring optical elements to precisely manipulate light for high-fidelity imaging. It is inherently a highly non-convex optimization problem that relies heavily on human heuristic expertise and domain-specific knowledge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) possess extensive optical knowledge, their capabilities in leveraging the knowledge in designing lens system remain significantly constrained. This work represents the first attempt to employ LLMs in the field of optical design. We bridge the expertise gap by enabling users without formal optical training to successfully develop functional lens systems. Concretely, we curate a comprehensive dataset, named OptiDesignQA, which encompasses both classical lens systems sourced from standard optical textbooks and novel configurations generated by automated design algorithms for training and evaluation. Furthermore, we inject domain-specific optical expertise into the LLM through a hybrid objective of full-system synthesis and lens completion. To align the model with optical principles, we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization Done Right (DrGRPO) guided by Optical Lexicographic Reward for physics-driven policy alignment. This reward system incorporates structural format rewards, physical feasibility rewards, light-manipulation accuracy, and LLM-based heuristics. Finally, our model integrates with specialized optical optimization routines for end-to-end fine-tuning and precision refinement. We benchmark our proposed method against both traditional optimization-based automated design algorithms and LLM counterparts, and experimental results show the superiority of our method.]]></description>

Accurately segmenting objects without any manual annotations remains one of the core challenges in computer vision. In this work, we introduce Selfment, a fully self-supervised framework that segments foreground objects directly from raw images without human labels, pretrained segmentation models, or any post-processing. Selfment first constructs patch-level affinity graphs from self-supervised features and applies NCut to obtain an initial coarse foreground--background separation. We then introduce Iterative Patch Optimization (IPO), a feature-space refinement procedure that progressively enforces spatial coherence and semantic consistency through iterative patch clustering. The refined masks are subsequently used as supervisory signals to train a lightweight segmentation head with contrastive and region-consistency objectives, allowing the model to learn stable and transferable object representations. Despite its simplicity and complete absence of manual supervision, Selfment sets new state-of-the-art (SoTA) results across multiple benchmarks. It achieves substantial improvements on $F_{\max}$ over previous unsupervised saliency detection methods on ECSSD ($+4.0\%$), HKUIS ($+4.6\%$), and PASCAL-S ($+5.7\%$). Moreover, without any additional fine-tuning, Selfment demonstrates remarkable zero-shot generalization to camouflaged object detection tasks (e.g., $0.910$ $S_m$ on CHAMELEON and $0.792$ $F_β^ω$ on CAMO), outperforming all existing unsupervised approaches and even rivaling the SoTA fully supervised methods.]]></description>

We present Neural Image-Space Tessellation (NIST), a lightweight screen-space post-processing approach that produces the visual effect of tessellated geometry while rendering only the original low-polygon meshes. Inspired by our observation from Phong tessellation, NIST leverages the discrepancy between geometric normals and shading normals as a minimal, view-dependent cue for silhouette refinement. At its core, NIST performs multi-scale neural tessellation by progressively deforming image-space contours with convolutional operators, while jointly reassigning appearance information through an implicit warping mechanism to preserve texture coherence and visual fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that our approach produces smooth, visually coherent silhouettes comparable to geometric tessellation, while incurring a constant per-frame cost and fully decoupled from geometric complexity, making it well-suited for large-scale real-time rendering scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, our NIST is the first work to reformulate tessellation as a post-processing operation, shifting it from a pre-rendering geometry pipeline to a screen space neural post-processing stage.]]></description>

This study addresses the issues of semantic entanglement, unclear label structure, and insufficient feature representation in few-shot text classification, and proposes an optimization framework based on structured prompts to enhance semantic understanding and task adaptation under low-resource conditions. The framework first uses a pretrained language model to encode the input text and obtain basic semantic representations. It then introduces structured prompts composed of multi-dimensional semantic factors and integrates them with text features through a learnable combination mechanism, which forms task-related representations with clear boundaries in the latent space. To further strengthen the consistency between text representations and label semantics, the method constructs a structured label embedding matrix and employs a cross-space alignment mechanism to ensure stable matching between textual features and label attributes. In addition, the model applies prompt orthogonality constraints and a joint optimization objective to maintain independence across different semantic factors in the prompts, allowing the structured prompts to provide transparent and controllable guidance for classification decisions. Three types of sensitivity experiments, including learning rate sensitivity, prompt length sensitivity, and data scale sensitivity, are designed to evaluate the stability and robustness of the framework under different conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed structured prompt optimization framework effectively alleviates semantic conflicts and label ambiguity in few-shot text classification. It significantly improves performance on accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC, and demonstrates strong cross-task applicability.]]></description>

Despite the success of deep learning in dermoscopy image analysis, its inherent black-box nature hinders clinical trust, motivating the use of prototypical networks for case-based visual transparency. However, inevitable selection bias in clinical data often drives these models toward shortcut learning, where environmental confounders are erroneously encoded as predictive prototypes, generating spurious visual evidence that misleads medical decision-making. To mitigate these confounding effects, we propose CausalProto, an Unsupervised Causal Prototypical Network that fundamentally purifies the visual evidence chain. Framed within a Structural Causal Model, we employ an Information Bottleneck-constrained encoder to enforce strict unsupervised orthogonal disentanglement between pathological features and environmental confounders. By mapping these decoupled representations into independent prototypical spaces, we leverage the learned spurious dictionary to perform backdoor adjustment via do-calculus, transforming complex causal interventions into efficient expectation pooling to marginalize environmental noise. Extensive experiments on multiple dermoscopy datasets demonstrate that CausalProto achieves superior diagnostic performance and consistently outperforms standard black box models, while simultaneously providing transparent and high purity visual interpretability without suffering from the traditional accuracy compromise.]]></description>

Predictive hotspot mapping is an important problem in crime prediction and control. An accurate hotspot mapping helps in appropriately targeting the available resources to manage crime in cities. With an aim to make data-driven decisions and automate policing and patrolling operations, police departments across the world are moving towards predictive approaches relying on historical data. In this paper, we create a non-parametric model using a spatio-temporal kernel density formulation for the purpose of crime prediction based on historical data. The proposed approach is also able to incorporate expert inputs coming from humans through alternate sources. The approach has been extensively evaluated in a real-world setting by collaborating with the Delhi police department to make crime predictions that would help in effective assignment of patrol vehicles to control street crime. The results obtained in the paper are promising and can be easily applied in other settings. We release the algorithm and the dataset (masked) used in our study to support future research that will be useful in achieving further improvements.]]></description>

High text recognition performance does not guarantee that Vision-Language Models (VLMs) share human-like decision patterns when resolving ambiguity. We investigate this behavioral gap by directly comparing humans and VLMs using continuously interpolated Japanese character shapes generated via a $β$-VAE. We estimate decision boundaries in a single-character recognition (shape-only task) and evaluate whether VLM responses align with human judgments under shape in context (i.e., embedding an ambiguous character near the human decision boundary in word-level context). We find that human and VLM decision boundaries differ in the shape-only task, and that shape in context can improve human alignment in some conditions. These results highlight qualitative behavioral differences, offering foundational insights toward human--VLM alignment benchmarking.]]></description>

Full-stack multimodal interaction in real-time is a central goal in building intelligent embodied agents capable of natural, dynamic communication. However, existing systems are either limited to unimodal generation or suffer from degraded reasoning and poor cross-modal alignment, preventing coherent and perceptually grounded interactions. In this work, we introduce U-Mind, the first unified system for high-intelligence multimodal dialogue that supports real-time generation and jointly models language, speech, motion, and video synthesis within a single interactive loop. At its core, U-Mind implements a Unified Alignment and Reasoning Framework that addresses two key challenges: enhancing cross-modal synchronization via a segment-wise alignment strategy, and preserving reasoning abilities through Rehearsal-Driven Learning. During inference, U-Mind adopts a text-first decoding pipeline that performs internal chain-of-thought planning followed by temporally synchronized generation across modalities. To close the loop, we implement a real-time video rendering framework conditioned on pose and speech, enabling expressive and synchronized visual feedback. Extensive experiments demonstrate that U-Mind achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of multimodal interaction tasks, including question answering, instruction following, and motion generation, paving the way toward intelligent, immersive conversational agents.]]></description>

Cross-domain reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn transferable policies under dynamics shifts between source and target domains. A key challenge lies in the lack of target-domain environment interaction and reward supervision, which prevents direct policy learning. To address this challenge, we propose Bridging Dynamics Gaps for Cross-Domain Reinforcement Learning (BDGxRL), a novel framework that leverages Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge (DSB) to align source transitions with target-domain dynamics encoded in offline demonstrations. Moreover, we introduce a reward modulation mechanism that estimates rewards based on state transitions, applying to DSB-aligned samples to ensure consistency between rewards and target-domain dynamics. BDGxRL performs target-oriented policy learning entirely within the source domain, without access to the target environment or its rewards. Experiments on MuJoCo cross-domain benchmarks demonstrate that BDGxRL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and shows strong adaptability under transition dynamics shifts.]]></description>

One-stream Transformer-based trackers achieve advanced performance in visual object tracking but suffer from significant computational overhead that hinders real-time deployment. While token pruning offers a path to efficiency, existing methods are fragmented. They typically prune the search region, dynamic template, and static template in isolation, overlooking critical inter-component dependencies, which yields suboptimal pruning and degraded accuracy. To address this, we introduce UTPTrack, a simple and Unified Token Pruning framework that, for the first time, jointly compresses all three components. UTPTrack employs an attention-guided, token type-aware strategy to holistically model redundancy, a design that seamlessly supports unified tracking across multimodal and language-guided tasks within a single model. Extensive evaluations on 10 benchmarks demonstrate that UTPTrack achieves a new state-of-the-art in the accuracy-efficiency trade-off for pruning-based trackers, pruning 65.4% of vision tokens in RGB-based tracking and 67.5% in unified tracking while preserving 99.7% and 100.5% of baseline performance, respectively. This strong performance across both RGB and multimodal scenarios underlines its potential as a robust foundation for future research in efficient visual tracking. Code will be released at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/UTPTrack.]]></description>

Diffusion models are able to produce AI-generated images that are almost indistinguishable from real ones. This raises concerns about their potential misuse and poses substantial challenges for detecting them. Many existing detectors rely on reconstruction error -- the difference between the input image and its reconstructed version -- as the basis for distinguishing real from fake images. However, these detectors become less effective as modern AI-generated images become increasingly similar to real ones. To address this challenge, we propose a novel difference-in-difference method. Instead of directly using the reconstruction error (a first-order difference), we compute the difference in reconstruction error -- a second-order difference -- for variance reduction and improving detection accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong generalization performance, enabling reliable detection of AI-generated images in the era of generative AI.]]></description>

Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) pursue omni-perception capabilities, yet integrating robust sensory grounding with complex reasoning remains a challenge, particularly for underrepresented regions. In this report, we introduce the research preview of MERaLiON2-Omni (Alpha), a 10B-parameter multilingual omni-perception tailored for Southeast Asia (SEA). We present a progressive training pipeline that explicitly decouples and then integrates "System 1" (Perception) and "System 2" (Reasoning) capabilities. First, we establish a robust Perception Backbone by aligning region-specific audio-visual cues (e.g., Singlish code-switching, local cultural landmarks) with a multilingual LLM through orthogonal modality adaptation. Second, to inject cognitive capabilities without large-scale supervision, we propose a cost-effective Generate-Judge-Refine pipeline. By utilizing a Super-LLM to filter hallucinations and resolve conflicts via a consensus mechanism, we synthesize high-quality silver data that transfers textual Chain-of-Thought reasoning to multimodal scenarios.
  Comprehensive evaluation on our newly introduced SEA-Omni Benchmark Suite reveals an Efficiency-Stability Paradox: while reasoning acts as a non-linear amplifier for abstract tasks (boosting mathematical and instruction-following performance significantly), it introduces instability in low-level sensory processing. Specifically, we identify Temporal Drift in long-context audio, where extended reasoning desynchronizes the model from acoustic timestamps, and Visual Over-interpretation, where logic overrides pixel-level reality. This report details the architecture, the data-efficient training recipe, and a diagnostic analysis of the trade-offs between robust perception and structured reasoning.]]></description>

The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) has predominantly relied on static datasets, which offer limited scalability and fail to capture the evolving reasoning capabilities of recent models. To overcome these limitations, we propose an agent-centric benchmarking paradigm that moves beyond static datasets by introducing a dynamic protocol in which autonomous agents iteratively generate, validate, and solve problems. Within this protocol, a teacher agent generates candidate problems, an orchestrator agent rigorously verifies their validity and guards against adversarial attacks, and a student agent attempts to solve the validated problems. An invalid problem is revised by the teacher agent until it passes validation. If the student correctly solves the problem, the orchestrator prompts the teacher to generate more challenging variants. Consequently, the benchmark scales in difficulty automatically as more capable agents are substituted into any role, enabling progressive evaluation of large language models without manually curated datasets. Adopting text anomaly detection as our primary evaluation format, which demands cross-sentence logical inference and resists pattern-matching shortcuts, we demonstrate that this protocol systematically exposes corner-case reasoning errors that conventional benchmarks fail to reveal. We further advocate evaluating systems along several complementary axes including cross-model pairwise performance and progress between the initial and orchestrator-finalized problems. By shifting the focus from fixed datasets to dynamic protocols, our approach offers a sustainable direction for evaluating ever-evolving language models and introduces a research agenda centered on the co-evolution of agent-centric benchmarks.]]></description>

Embodied AI requires sub-second inference near the Radio Access Network (RAN), but deployments span heterogeneous tiers (on-device, RAN-edge, cloud) and must not disrupt real-time baseband processing. We report measurements from a 5G Standalone (SA) AI-RAN testbed using a fixed baseline policy for repeatability. The setup includes an on-device tier, a three-node RAN-edge cluster co-hosting a containerized 5G RAN, and a cloud tier. We find that on-device execution remains multi-second and fails to meet sub-second budgets. At the RAN edge, SLA feasibility is primarily determined by model variant choice: quantized models concentrate below 0.5\,s, while unquantized and some larger quantized models incur deadline misses due to stalls and queuing. In the cloud tier, meeting a 0.5\,s deadline is challenging on the measured WAN path (up to 32.9\% of requests complete within 0.5\,s), but all evaluated variants meet a 1.0\,s deadline (100\% within 1.0\,s). Under saturated downlink traffic and up to $N{=}20$ concurrent inference clients, Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) isolation preserves baseband timing-health proxies, supporting safe co-location under fixed partitioning.]]></description>

Vision-language-action (VLA) models integrate visual observations and language instructions to predict robot actions, demonstrating promising generalization in manipulation tasks. However, most existing approaches primarily rely on direct mappings from 2D visual inputs to action sequences, without explicitly modeling the underlying 3D spatial structure or temporal world dynamics. Such representations may limit spatial reasoning and long-horizon decision-making in dynamic environments. To address this limitation, we propose StemVLA, a novel framework that explicitly incorporates both future-oriented 3D spatial knowledge and historical 4D spatiotemporal representations into action prediction. First, instead of relying solely on observed images, StemVLA forecasts structured 3D future spatial-geometric world knowledge, enabling the model to anticipate upcoming scene geometry and object configurations. Second, to capture temporal consistency and motion dynamics, we feed historical image frames into a pretrained video-geometry transformer backbone to extract implicit 3D world representations, and further aggregate them across time using a temporal attention module, termed VideoFormer [20], forming a unified 4D historical spatiotemporal representation. By jointly modeling 2D observations, predicted 3D future structure, and aggregated 4D temporal dynamics, StemVLA enables more comprehensive world understanding for robot manipulation. Extensive experiments in simulation demonstrate that StemVLA significantly improves long-horizon task success and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmark [46], achieving an average sequence length of XXX.]]></description>

The field of Artificial Intelligence is undergoing a transition from Generative AI -- probabilistic generation of text and images -- to Agentic AI, in which autonomous systems execute actions within external environments on behalf of users. This transition exposes a fundamental architectural mismatch: Large Language Models (LLMs) produce stochastic, unstructured outputs, whereas the backend infrastructure they must control -- databases, APIs, cloud services -- requires deterministic, schema-conformant inputs. The present paper describes the Auton Agentic AI Framework, a principled architecture for standardizing the creation, execution, and governance of autonomous agent systems. The framework is organized around a strict separation between the Cognitive Blueprint, a declarative, language-agnostic specification of agent identity and capabilities, and the Runtime Engine, the platform-specific execution substrate that instantiates and runs the agent. This separation enables cross-language portability, formal auditability, and modular tool integration via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The paper formalizes the agent execution model as an augmented Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) with a latent reasoning space, introduces a hierarchical memory consolidation architecture inspired by biological episodic memory systems, defines a constraint manifold formalism for safety enforcement via policy projection rather than post-hoc filtering, presents a three-level self-evolution framework spanning in-context adaptation through reinforcement learning, and describes runtime optimizations -- including parallel graph execution, speculative inference, and dynamic context pruning -- that reduce end-to-end latency for multi-step agent workflows.]]></description>

In UAV dynamic decision, complex and variable hazardous factors pose severe challenges to the generalization capability of algorithms. Despite offering semantic understanding and scene generalization, Large Language Models (LLM) lack domain-specific UAV control knowledge and formal safety assurances, restricting their direct applicability. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a train-free two-layer decision architecture based on LLMs, integrating high-level safety planning with low-level precise control. The framework introduces three key contributions: 1) A fuzzy Control Barrier Function verification mechanism for semantically-augmented actions, providing provable safety certification for LLM outputs. 2) A star-hierarchical graph-based retrieval-augmented generation system, enabling efficient, elastic, and interpretable scene adaptation. 3) Systematic experimental validation in pursuit-evasion scenarios with unknown obstacles and emergent threats, demonstrating that our SAGE-LLM maintains performance while significantly enhancing safety and generalization without online training. The proposed framework demonstrates strong extensibility, suggesting its potential for generalization to broader embodied intelligence systems and safety-critical control domains.]]></description>

Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents show promise for e-commerce conversational shopping, yet existing implementations lack the interaction depth and contextual breadth required for complex product research. Meanwhile, the Deep Research paradigm, despite advancing information synthesis in web search, suffers from domain gaps when transferred to e-commerce. We propose ProductResearch, a multi-agent framework that synthesizes high-fidelity, long-horizon tool-use trajectories for training robust e-commerce shopping agents. The framework employs a User Agent to infer nuanced shopping intents from behavioral histories, and a Supervisor Agent that orchestrates iterative collaboration with a Research Agent to generate synthetic trajectories culminating in comprehensive, insightful product research reports. These trajectories are rigorously filtered and distilled through a reflective internalization process that consolidates multi-agent supervisory interactions into coherent single-role training examples, enabling effective fine-tuning of LLM agents for complex shopping inquiries. Extensive experiments show that a compact MoE model fine-tuned on our synthetic data achieves substantial improvements over its base model in response comprehensiveness, research depth, and user-perceived utility, approaching the performance of frontier proprietary deep research systems and establishing multi-agent synthetic trajectory training as an effective and scalable paradigm for enhancing LLM-based shopping assistance.]]></description>
