As LLM-based agents are deployed in increasingly complex real-world settings, existing benchmarks underrepresent key challenges such as enforcing global constraints, coordinating multi-tool reasoning, and adapting to evolving user behavior over long, multi-turn interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRIP-Bench, a long-horizon benchmark grounded in realistic travel-planning scenarios. TRIP-Bench leverages real-world data, offers 18 curated tools and 40+ travel requirements, and supports automated evaluation. It includes splits of varying difficulty; the hard split emphasizes long and ambiguous interactions, style shifts, feasibility changes, and iterative version revision. Dialogues span up to 15 user turns, can involve 150+ tool calls, and may exceed 200k tokens of context. Experiments show that even advanced models achieve at most 50\% success on the easy split, with performance dropping below 10\% on hard subsets. We further propose GTPO, an online multi-turn reinforcement learning method with specialized reward normalization and reward differencing. Applied to Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, GTPO improves constraint satisfaction and interaction robustness, outperforming Gemini-3-Pro in our evaluation. We expect TRIP-Bench to advance practical long-horizon interactive agents, and GTPO to provide an effective online RL recipe for robust long-horizon training.]]></description>

Methods for controlling large language models (LLMs), including local weight fine-tuning, LoRA-based adaptation, and activation-based interventions, are often studied in isolation, obscuring their connections and making comparison difficult. In this work, we present a unified view that frames these interventions as dynamic weight updates induced by a control signal, placing them within a single conceptual framework. Building on this view, we propose a unified preference-utility analysis that separates control effects into preference, defined as the tendency toward a target concept, and utility, defined as coherent and task-valid generation, and measures both on a shared log-odds scale using polarity-paired contrastive examples. Across methods, we observe a consistent trade-off between preference and utility: stronger control increases preference while predictably reducing utility. We further explain this behavior through an activation manifold perspective, in which control shifts representations along target-concept directions to enhance preference, while utility declines primarily when interventions push representations off the model's valid-generation manifold. Finally, we introduce a new steering approach SPLIT guided by this analysis that improves preference while better preserving utility. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit/blob/main/examples/SPLIT.md.]]></description>

Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising method for interpreting neural network representations by decomposing activations into sparse combinations of dictionary atoms. However, SAEs assume that features combine additively through linear reconstruction, an assumption that cannot capture compositional structure: linear models cannot distinguish whether "Starbucks" arises from the composition of "star" and "coffee" features or merely their co-occurrence. This forces SAEs to allocate monolithic features for compound concepts rather than decomposing them into interpretable constituents. We introduce PolySAE, which extends the SAE decoder with higher-order terms to model feature interactions while preserving the linear encoder essential for interpretability. Through low-rank tensor factorization on a shared projection subspace, PolySAE captures pairwise and triple feature interactions with small parameter overhead (3% on GPT2). Across four language models and three SAE variants, PolySAE achieves an average improvement of approximately 8% in probing F1 while maintaining comparable reconstruction error, and produces 2-10times larger Wasserstein distances between class-conditional feature distributions. Critically, learned interaction weights exhibit negligible correlation with co-occurrence frequency (r = 0.06 vs. r = 0.82 for SAE feature covariance), suggesting that polynomial terms capture compositional structure, such as morphological binding and phrasal composition, largely independent of surface statistics.]]></description>

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities through step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Nevertheless, at the limits of model capability, CoT often proves insufficient, and its strictly sequential nature constrains test-time scalability. A potential alternative is divide-and-conquer (DAC) reasoning, which decomposes a complex problem into subproblems to facilitate more effective exploration of the solution. Although promising, our analysis reveals a fundamental misalignment between general-purpose post-training and DAC-style inference, which limits the model's capacity to fully leverage this potential. To bridge this gap and fully unlock LLMs' reasoning capabilities on the most challenging tasks, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework to enhance their DAC-style reasoning capacity. At each step, the policy decomposes a problem into a group of subproblems, solves them sequentially, and addresses the original one conditioned on the subproblem solutions, with both decomposition and solution integrated into RL training. Under comparable training, our DAC-style framework endows the model with a higher performance ceiling and stronger test-time scalability, surpassing CoT by 8.6% in Pass@1 and 6.3% in Pass@32 on competition-level benchmarks.]]></description>

Pan-cancer screening in large-scale CT scans remains challenging for existing AI methods, primarily due to the difficulty of localizing diverse types of tiny lesions in large CT volumes. The extreme foreground-background imbalance significantly hinders models from focusing on diseased regions, while redundant focus on healthy regions not only decreases the efficiency but also increases false positives. Inspired by radiologists' glance and focus diagnostic strategy, we introduce GF-Screen, a Glance and Focus reinforcement learning framework for pan-cancer screening. GF-Screen employs a Glance model to localize the diseased regions and a Focus model to precisely segment the lesions, where segmentation results of the Focus model are leveraged to reward the Glance model via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, the Glance model crops a group of sub-volumes from the entire CT volume and learns to select the sub-volumes with lesions for the Focus model to segment. Given that the selecting operation is non-differentiable for segmentation training, we propose to employ the segmentation results to reward the Glance model. To optimize the Glance model, we introduce a novel group relative learning paradigm, which employs group relative comparison to prioritize high-advantage predictions and discard low-advantage predictions within sub-volume groups, not only improving efficiency but also reducing false positives. In this way, for the first time, we effectively extend cutting-edge RL techniques to tackle the specific challenges in pan-cancer screening. Extensive experiments on 16 internal and 7 external datasets across 9 lesion types demonstrated the effectiveness of GF-Screen. Notably, GF-Screen leads the public validation leaderboard of MICCAI FLARE25 pan-cancer challenge, surpassing the FLARE24 champion solution by a large margin (+25.6% DSC and +28.2% NSD).]]></description>

Aligning objects with corresponding textual descriptions is a fundamental challenge and a realistic requirement in vision-language understanding. While recent multimodal embedding models excel at global image-text alignment, they often struggle with fine-grained alignment between image regions and specific phrases. In this work, we present ObjEmbed, a novel MLLM embedding model that decomposes the input image into multiple regional embeddings, each corresponding to an individual object, along with global embeddings. It supports a wide range of visual understanding tasks like visual grounding, local image retrieval, and global image retrieval. ObjEmbed enjoys three key properties: (1) Object-Oriented Representation: It captures both semantic and spatial aspects of objects by generating two complementary embeddings for each region: an object embedding for semantic matching and an IoU embedding that predicts localization quality. The final object matching score combines semantic similarity with the predicted IoU, enabling more accurate retrieval. (2) Versatility: It seamlessly handles both region-level and image-level tasks. (3) Efficient Encoding: All objects in an image, along with the full image, are encoded in a single forward pass for high efficiency. Superior performance on 18 diverse benchmarks demonstrates its strong semantic discrimination.]]></description>

Reinforcement learning has become central to post-training large language models, yet dominant algorithms rely on clipping mechanisms that introduce optimization issues at scale, including zero-gradient regions, reward hacking, and training instability. We propose Clipping-Free Policy Optimization (CFPO), which replaces heuristic clipping with a convex quadratic penalty derived from Total Variation divergence constraints, yielding an everywhere-differentiable objective that enforces stable policy updates without hard boundaries. We evaluate CFPO across both reasoning and alignment settings. In reasoning, CFPO matches clipping-based methods on downstream benchmarks while extending the stable training regime. In alignment, CFPO mitigates verbosity exploitation and reduces capability degradation, while achieving competitive instruction-following performance. CFPO requires only a one-line code change and no additional hyperparameters. Our results suggest that CFPO is a promising drop-in alternative to clipping-based methods for LLM post-training.]]></description>

Reservoir Computing (RC) has established itself as an efficient paradigm for temporal processing. However, its scalability remains severely constrained by (i) the necessity of processing temporal data sequentially and (ii) the prohibitive memory footprint of high-dimensional reservoirs. In this work, we revisit RC through the lens of structured operators and state space modeling to address these limitations, introducing Parallel Echo State Network (ParalESN). ParalESN enables the construction of high-dimensional and efficient reservoirs based on diagonal linear recurrence in the complex space, enabling parallel processing of temporal data. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that ParalESN preserves the Echo State Property and the universality guarantees of traditional Echo State Networks while admitting an equivalent representation of arbitrary linear reservoirs in the complex diagonal form. Empirically, ParalESN matches the predictive accuracy of traditional RC on time series benchmarks, while delivering substantial computational savings. On 1-D pixel-level classification tasks, ParalESN achieves competitive accuracy with fully trainable neural networks while reducing computational costs and energy consumption by orders of magnitude. Overall, ParalESN offers a promising, scalable, and principled pathway for integrating RC within the deep learning landscape.]]></description>

Automating AI research differs from general software engineering due to computationally expensive evaluation (e.g., model training) and opaque performance attribution. Current LLM-based agents struggle here, often generating monolithic scripts that ignore execution costs and causal factors. We introduce MARS (Modular Agent with Reflective Search), a framework optimized for autonomous AI research. MARS relies on three pillars: (1) Budget-Aware Planning via cost-constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explicitly balance performance with execution expense; (2) Modular Construction, employing a "Design-Decompose-Implement" pipeline to manage complex research repositories; and (3) Comparative Reflective Memory, which addresses credit assignment by analyzing solution differences to distill high-signal insights. MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source frameworks on MLE-Bench under comparable settings, maintaining competitiveness with the global leaderboard's top methods. Furthermore, the system exhibits qualitative "Aha!" moments, where 63% of all utilized lessons originate from cross-branch transfer, demonstrating that the agent effectively generalizes insights across search paths.]]></description>

Direct preference optimization methods have emerged as a computationally efficient alternative to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs). Latest approaches have streamlined the alignment process by deriving implicit reward functions, yet they often suffer from a critical objective mismatch: optimizing the relative margin between chosen and rejected responses does not guarantee the preservation of the chosen response's absolute likelihood. This can lead to ``unlearning'', where the model degrades the probability of high-quality outputs to satisfy margin constraints, and ``formatting collapse'' caused by the over-penalization of rejected sequences. In this work, we introduce SLIME (Stabilized Likelihood Implicit Margin Enforcement), a reference-free alignment objective designed to decouple preference learning from generation quality. SLIME incorporates a three-pronged objective: (1) an anchoring term to maximize the likelihood of preferred responses; (2) a stabilizing penalty that prevents the probabilities of rejected tokens from collapsing to zero; and (3) a dual-margin mechanism that combines hard and soft constraints for precise boundary shaping. Our results demonstrate that SLIME achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining higher generation stability.]]></description>

Autoregressive video diffusion models enable streaming generation, opening the door to long-form synthesis, video world models, and interactive neural game engines. However, their core attention layers become a major bottleneck at inference time: as generation progresses, the KV cache grows, causing both increasing latency and escalating GPU memory, which in turn restricts usable temporal context and harms long-range consistency. In this work, we study redundancy in autoregressive video diffusion and identify three persistent sources: near-duplicate cached keys across frames, slowly evolving (largely semantic) queries/keys that make many attention computations redundant, and cross-attention over long prompts where only a small subset of tokens matters per frame. Building on these observations, we propose a unified, training-free attention framework for autoregressive diffusion: TempCache compresses the KV cache via temporal correspondence to bound cache growth; AnnCA accelerates cross-attention by selecting frame-relevant prompt tokens using fast approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) matching; and AnnSA sparsifies self-attention by restricting each query to semantically matched keys, also using a lightweight ANN. Together, these modules reduce attention, compute, and memory and are compatible with existing autoregressive diffusion backbones and world models. Experiments demonstrate up to x5--x10 end-to-end speedups while preserving near-identical visual quality and, crucially, maintaining stable throughput and nearly constant peak GPU memory usage over long rollouts, where prior methods progressively slow down and suffer from increasing memory usage.]]></description>

Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have significantly propelled the development of visual generation. Existing frameworks typically adopt Bradley-Terry-style preference modeling or leverage generative VLMs as judges, and subsequently optimize visual generation models via reinforcement learning. However, current RMs suffer from inherent limitations: they often follow a one-size-fits-all paradigm that assumes a monolithic preference distribution or relies on fixed evaluation rubrics. As a result, they are insensitive to content-specific visual cues, leading to systematic misalignment with subjective and context-dependent human preferences. To this end, inspired by human assessment, we propose UnifiedReward-Flex, a unified personalized reward model for vision generation that couples reward modeling with flexible and context-adaptive reasoning. Specifically, given a prompt and the generated visual content, it first interprets the semantic intent and grounds on visual evidence, then dynamically constructs a hierarchical assessment by instantiating fine-grained criteria under both predefined and self-generated high-level dimensions. Our training pipeline follows a two-stage process: (1) we first distill structured, high-quality reasoning traces from advanced closed-source VLMs to bootstrap SFT, equipping the model with flexible and context-adaptive reasoning behaviors; (2) we then perform direct preference optimization (DPO) on carefully curated preference pairs to further strengthen reasoning fidelity and discriminative alignment. To validate the effectiveness, we integrate UnifiedReward-Flex into the GRPO framework for image and video synthesis, and extensive results demonstrate its superiority.]]></description>

In this paper, we identify a sparse reward subsystem within the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs), drawing an analogy to the biological reward subsystem in the human brain. We demonstrate that this subsystem contains value neurons that represent the model's internal expectation of state value, and through intervention experiments, we establish the importance of these neurons for reasoning. Our experiments reveal that these value neurons are robust across diverse datasets, model scales, and architectures; furthermore, they exhibit significant transferability across different datasets and models fine-tuned from the same base model. By examining cases where value predictions and actual rewards diverge, we identify dopamine neurons within the reward subsystem which encode reward prediction errors (RPE). These neurons exhibit high activation when the reward is higher than expected and low activation when the reward is lower than expected.]]></description>

Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced LLM reasoning, but remains constrained by inefficient exploration under limited rollout budgets, leading to low sampling success and unstable training in complex tasks. We find that many exploration failures arise not from problem difficulty, but from a small number of prompt tokens that introduce interference. Building on this insight, we propose the Less Noise Sampling Framework (LENS), which first prompts by identifying and removing interference tokens. then transfers successful rollouts from the purification process to supervise policy optimization on the original noisy prompts, enabling the model to learn to ignore interference in the real-world, noisy prompting settings. Experimental results show that LENS significantly outperforms GRPO, delivering higher performance and faster convergence, with a 3.88% average gain and over 1.6times speedup. Our work highlights the critical role of pruning interference tokens in improving rollout efficiency, offering a new perspective for RLVR research.]]></description>

Deploying modern Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) in streaming settings requires systems that provide low latency, high throughput, and strong guarantees of streamability. Existing systems fall short of supporting diverse models flexibly and efficiently. We present VoxServe, a unified serving system for SpeechLMs that optimizes streaming performance. VoxServe introduces a model-execution abstraction that decouples model architecture from system-level optimizations, thereby enabling support for diverse SpeechLM architectures within a single framework. Building on this abstraction, VoxServe implements streaming-aware scheduling and an asynchronous inference pipeline to improve end-to-end efficiency. Evaluations across multiple modern SpeechLMs show that VoxServe achieves 10-20x higher throughput than existing implementations at comparable latency while maintaining high streaming viability. The code of VoxServe is available at https://github.com/vox-serve/vox-serve.]]></description>

Query-based universal sound separation is fundamental to intelligent auditory systems, aiming to isolate specific sources from mixtures. Despite recent advances, existing methods continue to suffer from residual interference in complex acoustic scenes. This performance limitation stems largely from a data bottleneck: in-the-wild datasets contain weak labels and severe co-occurrence of events. These flaws induce models to learn spurious correlations between background noise and target categories instead of robust acoustic features. To address this, we propose an automated pipeline that eliminates co-occurrence of events by mining high-purity single-event segments from in-the-wild datasets via a semantically consistent synthesis protocol. Utilizing this pipeline, we constructed Hive, a high-quality synthetic dataset comprising 2.4k hours of raw audio. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with the state-of-the-art model SAM-Audio which was trained on a huge dataset sim500 times larger than Hive, certain open-source models trained on Hive achieve competitive separation accuracy and perceptual quality. Moreover, these models exhibited remarkable zero-shot generalization on out-of-distribution evaluation benchmarks. These findings highlight that prioritizing purity of supervised signals enables significant data efficiency, offering a new paradigm for training robust auditory foundation models with reduced computational costs. Code and dataset are available at https://shandaai.github.io/Hive.]]></description>

We introduce WorldVQA, a benchmark designed to evaluate the atomic visual world knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike current evaluations, which often conflate visual knowledge retrieval with reasoning, WorldVQA decouples these capabilities to strictly measure "what the model memorizes." The benchmark assesses the atomic capability of grounding and naming visual entities across a stratified taxonomy, spanning from common head-class objects to long-tail rarities. We expect WorldVQA to serve as a rigorous test for visual factuality, thereby establishing a standard for assessing the encyclopedic breadth and hallucination rates of current and next-generation frontier models.]]></description>

Existing methods for human motion control in video generation typically rely on either 2D poses or explicit 3D parametric models (e.g., SMPL) as control signals. However, 2D poses rigidly bind motion to the driving viewpoint, precluding novel-view synthesis. Explicit 3D models, though structurally informative, suffer from inherent inaccuracies (e.g., depth ambiguity and inaccurate dynamics) which, when used as a strong constraint, override the powerful intrinsic 3D awareness of large-scale video generators. In this work, we revisit motion control from a 3D-aware perspective, advocating for an implicit, view-agnostic motion representation that naturally aligns with the generator's spatial priors rather than depending on externally reconstructed constraints. We introduce 3DiMo, which jointly trains a motion encoder with a pretrained video generator to distill driving frames into compact, view-agnostic motion tokens, injected semantically via cross-attention. To foster 3D awareness, we train with view-rich supervision (i.e., single-view, multi-view, and moving-camera videos), forcing motion consistency across diverse viewpoints. Additionally, we use auxiliary geometric supervision that leverages SMPL only for early initialization and is annealed to zero, enabling the model to transition from external 3D guidance to learning genuine 3D spatial motion understanding from the data and the generator's priors. Experiments confirm that 3DiMo faithfully reproduces driving motions with flexible, text-driven camera control, significantly surpassing existing methods in both motion fidelity and visual quality.]]></description>

Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), existing approaches often fail to generate personalized responses based on the user's specific experiences, as they lack the ability to associate visual inputs with a user's accumulated visual-textual context. We newly formalize this challenge as contextualized visual personalization, which requires the visual recognition and textual retrieval of personalized visual experiences by VLMs when interpreting new images. To address this issue, we propose CoViP, a unified framework that treats personalized image captioning as a core task for contextualized visual personalization and improves this capability through reinforcement-learning-based post-training and caption-augmented generation. We further introduce diagnostic evaluations that explicitly rule out textual shortcut solutions and verify whether VLMs truly leverage visual context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that existing open-source and proprietary VLMs exhibit substantial limitations, while CoViP not only improves personalized image captioning but also yields holistic gains across downstream personalization tasks. These results highlight CoViP as a crucial stage for enabling robust and generalizable contextualized visual personalization.]]></description>

While LLM-as-a-Judge is widely used in automated evaluation, existing validation practices primarily operate at the level of observed outputs, offering limited insight into whether LLM judges themselves function as stable and reliable measurement instruments. To address this limitation, we introduce a two-phase diagnostic framework for assessing reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge, grounded in Item Response Theory (IRT). The framework adopts Graded Response Model (GRM) of IRT and formalizes reliability along two complementary dimensions: (1) intrinsic consistency, defined as the stability of measurement behavior under prompt variations, and (2) human alignment, capturing correspondence with human quality assessments. We empirically examine diverse LLM judges with this framework, and show that leveraging IRT-GRM yields interpretable signals for diagnosing judgments systematically. These signals provide practical guidance for verifying reliablity of LLM-as-a-Judge and identifying potential causes of unreliability.]]></description>

Large language models can generate fluent answers that are unfaithful to the provided context, while many safeguards rely on external verification or a separate judge after generation. We introduce internal flow signatures that audit decision formation from depthwise dynamics at a fixed inter-block monitoring boundary. The method stabilizes token-wise motion via bias-centered monitoring, then summarizes trajectories in compact moving readout-aligned subspaces constructed from the top token and its close competitors within each depth window. Neighboring window frames are aligned by an orthogonal transport, yielding depth-comparable transported step lengths, turning angles, and subspace drift summaries that are invariant to within-window basis choices. A lightweight GRU validator trained on these signatures performs self-checking without modifying the base model. Beyond detection, the validator localizes a culprit depth event and enables a targeted refinement: the model rolls back to the culprit token and clamps an abnormal transported step at the identified block while preserving the orthogonal residual. The resulting pipeline provides actionable localization and low-overhead self-checking from internal decision dynamics. Code is available at github.com/EavnJeong/Internal-Flow-Signatures-for-Self-Checking-and-Refinement-in-LLMs.]]></description>

Mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) World Models (WMs) offer a promising path for improving mobile GUI agent performance at train- and inference-time. However, current approaches face a critical trade-off: text-based WMs sacrifice visual fidelity, while the inability of visual WMs in precise text rendering led to their reliance on slow, complex pipelines dependent on numerous external models. We propose a novel paradigm: visual world modeling via renderable code generation, where a single Vision-Language Model (VLM) predicts the next GUI state as executable web code that renders to pixels, rather than generating pixels directly. This combines the strengths of both approaches: VLMs retain their linguistic priors for precise text rendering while their pre-training on structured web code enables high-fidelity visual generation. We introduce gWorld (8B, 32B), the first open-weight visual mobile GUI WMs built on this paradigm, along with a data generation framework (gWorld) that automatically synthesizes code-based training data. In extensive evaluation across 4 in- and 2 out-of-distribution benchmarks, gWorld sets a new pareto frontier in accuracy versus model size, outperforming 8 frontier open-weight models over 50.25x larger. Further analyses show that (1) scaling training data via gWorld yields meaningful gains, (2) each component of our pipeline improves data quality, and (3) stronger world modeling improves downstream mobile GUI policy performance.]]></description>

Semantic ID (SID)-based recommendation is a promising paradigm for scaling sequential recommender systems, but existing methods largely follow a semantic-centric pipeline: item embeddings are learned from foundation models and discretized using generic quantization schemes. This design is misaligned with generative recommendation objectives: semantic embeddings are weakly coupled with collaborative prediction, and generic quantization is inefficient at reducing sequential uncertainty for autoregressive modeling. To address these, we propose ReSID, a recommendation-native, principled SID framework that rethinks representation learning and quantization from the perspective of information preservation and sequential predictability, without relying on LLMs. ReSID consists of two components: (i) Field-Aware Masked Auto-Encoding (FAMAE), which learns predictive-sufficient item representations from structured features, and (ii) Globally Aligned Orthogonal Quantization (GAOQ), which produces compact and predictable SID sequences by jointly reducing semantic ambiguity and prefix-conditional uncertainty. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments across ten datasets show the effectiveness of ReSID. ReSID consistently outperforms strong sequential and SID-based generative baselines by an average of over 10%, while reducing tokenization cost by up to 122x. Code is available at https://github.com/FuCongResearchSquad/ReSID.]]></description>

Growing efforts to improve knowledge distillation (KD) in large language models (LLMs) replace dense teacher supervision with selective distillation, which uses a subset of token positions, vocabulary classes, or training samples for supervision. However, it remains unclear which importance signals, selection policies, and their interplay are most effective. In this work, we revisit where and how to distill in autoregressive LLMs. We disentangle selective KD along the position, class, and sample axes and systematically compare importance signals and selection policies. Then, guided by this analysis, we identify underexplored opportunities and introduce student-entropy-guided position selection (SE-KD). Across a suite of benchmarks, SE-KD often improves accuracy, downstream task adherence, and memory efficiency over dense distillation. Extending this approach across the class and sample axes (SE-KD 3X) yields complementary efficiency gains that make offline teacher caching feasible. In practice, this reduces wall time by 70% and peak memory by 18%, while cutting storage usage by 80% over prior methods without sacrificing performance.]]></description>

Chain-of-Thought reasoning has driven large language models to extend from thinking with text to thinking with images and videos. However, different modalities still have clear limitations: static images struggle to represent temporal structure, while videos introduce substantial redundancy and computational cost. In this work, we propose Thinking with Comics, a visual reasoning paradigm that uses comics as a high information-density medium positioned between images and videos. Comics preserve temporal structure, embedded text, and narrative coherence while requiring significantly lower reasoning cost. We systematically study two reasoning paths based on comics and evaluate them on a range of reasoning tasks and long-context understanding tasks. Experimental results show that Thinking with Comics outperforms Thinking with Images on multi-step temporal and causal reasoning tasks, while remaining substantially more efficient than Thinking with Video. Further analysis indicates that different comic narrative structures and styles consistently affect performance across tasks, suggesting that comics serve as an effective intermediate visual representation for improving multimodal reasoning.]]></description>

Nowadays, training and evaluating DeepResearch-generated reports remain challenging due to the lack of verifiable reward signals. Accordingly, rubric-based evaluation has become a common practice. However, existing approaches either rely on coarse, pre-defined rubrics that lack sufficient granularity, or depend on manually constructed query-specific rubrics that are costly and difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose a pipeline to train human-preference-aligned query-specific rubric generators tailored for DeepResearch report generation. We first construct a dataset of DeepResearch-style queries annotated with human preferences over paired reports, and train rubric generators via reinforcement learning with a hybrid reward combining human preference supervision and LLM-based rubric evaluation. To better handle long-horizon reasoning, we further introduce a Multi-agent Markov-state (MaMs) workflow for report generation. We empirically show that our proposed rubric generators deliver more discriminative and better human-aligned supervision than existing rubric design strategies. Moreover, when integrated into the MaMs training framework, DeepResearch systems equipped with our rubric generators consistently outperform all open-source baselines on the DeepResearch Bench and achieve performance comparable to that of leading closed-source models.]]></description>

Adaptive multimodal reasoning has emerged as a promising frontier in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), aiming to dynamically modulate between tool-augmented visual reasoning and text reasoning to enhance both effectiveness and efficiency. However, existing evaluations rely on static difficulty labels and simplistic metrics, which fail to capture the dynamic nature of difficulty relative to varying model capacities. Consequently, they obscure the distinction between adaptive mode selection and general performance while neglecting fine-grained process analyses. In this paper, we propose AdaptMMBench, a comprehensive benchmark for adaptive multimodal reasoning across five domains: real-world, OCR, GUI, knowledge, and math, encompassing both direct perception and complex reasoning tasks. AdaptMMBench utilizes a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) metric to evaluate the selection rationality of different reasoning modes, isolating this meta-cognition ability by dynamically identifying task difficulties based on models' capability boundaries. Moreover, AdaptMMBench facilitates multi-dimensional process evaluation across key step coverage, tool effectiveness, and computational efficiency. Our evaluation reveals that while adaptive mode selection scales with model capacity, it notably decouples from final accuracy. Conversely, key step coverage aligns with performance, though tool effectiveness remains highly inconsistent across model architectures.]]></description>

Search intelligence is evolving from Deep Research to Wide Research, a paradigm essential for retrieving and synthesizing comprehensive information under complex constraints in parallel. However, progress in this field is impeded by the lack of dedicated benchmarks and optimization methodologies for search breadth. To address these challenges, we take a deep dive into Wide Research from two perspectives: Data Pipeline and Agent Optimization. First, we produce WideSeekBench, a General Broad Information Seeking (GBIS) benchmark constructed via a rigorous multi-phase data pipeline to ensure diversity across the target information volume, logical constraints, and domains. Second, we introduce WideSeek, a dynamic hierarchical multi-agent architecture that can autonomously fork parallel sub-agents based on task requirements. Furthermore, we design a unified training framework that linearizes multi-agent trajectories and optimizes the system using end-to-end RL. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of WideSeek and multi-agent RL, highlighting that scaling the number of agents is a promising direction for advancing the Wide Research paradigm.]]></description>

Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on single-image tasks, but their performance declines when multiple images are provided as input. One major reason is the cross-image information leakage, where the model struggles to distinguish information across different images. Existing LVLMs already employ delimiter tokens to mark the start and end of each image, yet our analysis reveals that these tokens fail to effectively block cross-image information leakage. To enhance their effectiveness, we propose a method that scales the hidden states of delimiter tokens. This enhances the model's ability to preserve image-specific information by reinforcing intra-image interaction and limiting undesired cross-image interactions. Consequently, the model is better able to distinguish between images and reason over them more accurately. Experiments show performance gains on multi-image benchmarks such as Mantis, MuirBench, MIRB, and QBench2. We further evaluate our method on text-only tasks that require clear distinction. The method improves performance on multi-document and multi-table understanding benchmarks, including TQABench, MultiNews, and WCEP-10. Notably, our method requires no additional training or inference cost.]]></description>

Transformation-based privacy-preserving face recognition (PPFR) aims to verify identities while hiding facial data from attackers and malicious service providers. Existing evaluations mostly treat privacy as resistance to pixel-level reconstruction, measured by PSNR and SSIM. We show that this reconstruction-centric view fails. We present FaceLinkGen, an identity extraction attack that performs linkage/matching and face regeneration directly from protected templates without recovering original pixels. On three recent PPFR systems, FaceLinkGen reaches over 98.5\% matching accuracy and above 96\% regeneration success, and still exceeds 92\% matching and 94\% regeneration in a near zero knowledge setting. These results expose a structural gap between pixel distortion metrics, which are widely used in PPFR evaluation, and real privacy. We show that visual obfuscation leaves identity information broadly exposed to both external intruders and untrusted service providers.]]></description>

Determining an effective data mixture is a key factor in Large Language Model (LLM) pre-training, where models must balance general competence with proficiency on hard tasks such as math and code. However, identifying an optimal mixture remains an open challenge, as existing approaches either rely on unreliable tiny-scale proxy experiments or require prohibitively expensive large-scale exploration. To address this, we propose Decouple Searching from Training Mix (DeMix), a novel framework that leverages model merging to predict optimal data ratios. Instead of training proxy models for every sampled mixture, DeMix trains component models on candidate datasets at scale and derives data mixture proxies via weighted model merging. This paradigm decouples search from training costs, enabling evaluation of unlimited sampled mixtures without extra training burden and thus facilitating better mixture discovery through more search trials. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeMix breaks the trade-off between sufficiency, accuracy and efficiency, obtaining the optimal mixture with higher benchmark performance at lower search cost. Additionally, we release the DeMix Corpora, a comprehensive 22T-token dataset comprising high-quality pre-training data with validated mixtures to facilitate open research. Our code and DeMix Corpora is available at https://github.com/Lucius-lsr/DeMix.]]></description>

Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key approach for enhancing LLM reasoning.However, standard frameworks like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) typically employ a uniform rollout budget, leading to resource inefficiency. Moreover, existing adaptive methods often rely on instance-level metrics, such as task pass rates, failing to capture the model's dynamic learning state. To address these limitations, we propose CoBA-RL, a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to adaptively allocate rollout budgets based on the model's evolving capability. Specifically, CoBA-RL utilizes a Capability-Oriented Value function to map tasks to their potential training gains and employs a heap-based greedy strategy to efficiently self-calibrate the distribution of computational resources to samples with high training value. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively orchestrates the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, delivering consistent generalization improvements across multiple challenging benchmarks. These findings underscore that quantifying sample training value and optimizing budget allocation are pivotal for advancing LLM post-training efficiency.]]></description>

Search-integrated reasoning enables language agents to transcend static parametric knowledge by actively querying external sources. However, training these agents via reinforcement learning is hindered by the multi-scale credit assignment problem: existing methods typically rely on sparse, trajectory-level rewards that fail to distinguish between high-quality reasoning and fortuitous guesses, leading to redundant or misleading search behaviors. To address this, we propose Search-R2, a novel Actor-Refiner collaboration framework that enhances reasoning through targeted intervention, with both components jointly optimized during training. Our approach decomposes the generation process into an Actor, which produces initial reasoning trajectories, and a Meta-Refiner, which selectively diagnoses and repairs flawed steps via a 'cut-and-regenerate' mechanism. To provide fine-grained supervision, we introduce a hybrid reward design that couples outcome correctness with a dense process reward quantifying the information density of retrieved evidence. Theoretically, we formalize the Actor-Refiner interaction as a smoothed mixture policy, proving that selective correction yields strict performance gains over strong baselines. Extensive experiments across various general and multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that Search-R2 consistently outperforms strong RAG and RL-based baselines across model scales, achieving superior reasoning accuracy with minimal overhead.]]></description>

Many machine learning systems have access to multiple sources of evidence for the same prediction target, yet these sources often differ in reliability and informativeness across inputs. In bioacoustic classification, species identity may be inferred both from the acoustic signal and from spatiotemporal context such as location and season; while Bayesian inference motivates multiplicative evidence combination, in practice we typically only have access to discriminative predictors rather than calibrated generative models. We introduce Fusion under INdependent Conditional Hypotheses (FINCH), an adaptive log-linear evidence fusion framework that integrates a pre-trained audio classifier with a structured spatiotemporal predictor. FINCH learns a per-sample gating function that estimates the reliability of contextual information from uncertainty and informativeness statistics. The resulting fusion family contains the audio-only classifier as a special case and explicitly bounds the influence of contextual evidence, yielding a risk-contained hypothesis class with an interpretable audio-only fallback. Across benchmarks, FINCH consistently outperforms fixed-weight fusion and audio-only baselines, improving robustness and error trade-offs even when contextual information is weak in isolation. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on CBI and competitive or improved performance on several subsets of BirdSet using a lightweight, interpretable, evidence-based approach.

This paper presents YOLOE-26, a unified framework that integrates the deployment-optimized YOLO26(or YOLOv26) architecture with the open-vocabulary learning paradigm of YOLOE for real-time open-vocabulary instance segmentation. Building on the NMS-free, end-to-end design of YOLOv26, the proposed approach preserves the hallmark efficiency and determinism of the YOLO family while extending its capabilities beyond closed-set recognition. YOLOE-26 employs a convolutional backbone with PAN/FPN-style multi-scale feature aggregation, followed by end-to-end regression and instance segmentation heads. A key architectural contribution is the replacement of fixed class logits with an object embedding head, which formulates classification as similarity matching against prompt embeddings derived from text descriptions, visual examples, or a built-in vocabulary. To enable efficient open-vocabulary reasoning, the framework incorporates Re-Parameterizable Region-Text Alignment (RepRTA) for zero-overhead text prompting, a Semantic-Activated Visual Prompt Encoder (SAVPE) for example-guided segmentation, and Lazy Region Prompt Contrast for prompt-free inference. All prompting modalities operate within a unified object embedding space, allowing seamless switching between text-prompted, visual-prompted, and fully autonomous segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent scaling behavior and favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs across model sizes in both prompted and prompt-free settings. The training strategy leverages large-scale detection and grounding datasets with multi-task optimization and remains fully compatible with the Ultralytics ecosystem for training, validation, and deployment. Overall, YOLOE-26 provides a practical and scalable solution for real-time open-vocabulary instance segmentation in dynamic, real-world environments.]]></description>

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as judges to evaluate agent performance, particularly in non-verifiable settings where judgments rely on agent trajectories including chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. This paradigm implicitly assumes that the agent's CoT faithfully reflects both its internal reasoning and the underlying environment state. We show this assumption is brittle: LLM judges are highly susceptible to manipulation of agent reasoning traces. By systematically rewriting agent CoTs while holding actions and observations fixed, we demonstrate that manipulated reasoning alone can inflate false positive rates of state-of-the-art VLM judges by up to 90% across 800 trajectories spanning diverse web tasks. We study manipulation strategies spanning style-based approaches that alter only the presentation of reasoning and content-based approaches that fabricate signals of task progress, and find that content-based manipulations are consistently more effective. We evaluate prompting-based techniques and scaling judge-time compute, which reduce but do not fully eliminate susceptibility to manipulation. Our findings reveal a fundamental vulnerability in LLM-based evaluation and highlight the need for judging mechanisms that verify reasoning claims against observable evidence.]]></description>

Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in source code understanding, yet as software systems grow in scale, computational efficiency has become a critical bottleneck. Currently, these models rely on a text-based paradigm that treats source code as a linear sequence of tokens, which leads to a linear increase in context length and associated computational costs. The rapid advancement of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) introduces an opportunity to optimize efficiency by representing source code as rendered images. Unlike text, which is difficult to compress without losing semantic meaning, the image modality is inherently suitable for compression. By adjusting resolution, images can be scaled to a fraction of their original token cost while remaining recognizable to vision-capable models. To explore the feasibility of this approach, we conduct the first systematic study on the effectiveness of MLLMs for code understanding. Our experiments reveal that: (1) MLLMs can effectively understand code with substantial token reduction, achieving up to 8x compression; (2) MLLMs can effectively leverage visual cues such as syntax highlighting, improving code completion performance under 4x compression; and (3) Code-understanding tasks like clone detection exhibit exceptional resilience to visual compression, with some compression ratios even slightly outperforming raw text inputs. Our findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of MLLMs in code understanding, which points out a shift toward image-modality code representation as a pathway to more efficient inference.]]></description>

Computer-Using Agents (CUAs) aim to autonomously operate computer systems to complete real-world tasks. However, existing agentic systems remain difficult to scale and lag behind human performance. A key limitation is the absence of reusable and structured skill abstractions that capture how humans interact with graphical user interfaces and how to leverage these skills. We introduce CUA-Skill, a computer-using agentic skill base that encodes human computer-use knowledge as skills coupled with parameterized execution and composition graphs. CUA-Skill is a large-scale library of carefully engineered skills spanning common Windows applications, serving as a practical infrastructure and tool substrate for scalable, reliable agent development. Built upon this skill base, we construct CUA-Skill Agent, an end-to-end computer-using agent that supports dynamic skill retrieval, argument instantiation, and memory-aware failure recovery. Our results demonstrate that CUA-Skill substantially improves execution success rates and robustness on challenging end-to-end agent benchmarks, establishing a strong foundation for future computer-using agent development. On WindowsAgentArena, CUA-Skill Agent achieves state-of-the-art 57.5% (best of three) successful rate while being significantly more efficient than prior and concurrent approaches.

Parallel thinking has emerged as a promising paradigm for reasoning, yet it imposes significant computational burdens. Existing efficiency methods primarily rely on local, per-trajectory signals and lack principled mechanisms to exploit global dynamics across parallel branches. We introduce 2D probing, an interface that exposes the width-depth dynamics of parallel thinking by periodically eliciting intermediate answers from all branches. Our analysis reveals three key insights: non-monotonic scaling across width-depth allocations, heterogeneous reasoning branch lengths, and early stabilization of global consensus. Guided by these insights, we introduce Parallel-Probe, a training-free controller designed to optimize online parallel thinking. Parallel-Probe employs consensus-based early stopping to regulate reasoning depth and deviation-based branch pruning to dynamically adjust width. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and multiple models demonstrate that Parallel-Probe establishes a superior Pareto frontier for test-time scaling. Compared to standard majority voting, it reduces sequential tokens by up to 35.8% and total token cost by over 25.8% while maintaining competitive accuracy.]]></description>

The agency expected of Agentic Large Language Models goes beyond answering correctly, requiring autonomy to set goals and decide what to explore. We term this investigatory intelligence, distinguishing it from executional intelligence, which merely completes assigned tasks. Data Science provides a natural testbed, as real-world analysis starts from raw data rather than explicit queries, yet few benchmarks focus on it. To address this, we introduce Deep Data Research (DDR), an open-ended task where LLMs autonomously extract key insights from databases, and DDR-Bench, a large-scale, checklist-based benchmark that enables verifiable evaluation. Results show that while frontier models display emerging agency, long-horizon exploration remains challenging. Our analysis highlights that effective investigatory intelligence depends not only on agent scaffolding or merely scaling, but also on intrinsic strategies of agentic models.]]></description>

In discrete generative modeling, two dominant paradigms demonstrate divergent capabilities: Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLM) excel at semantic understanding and zero-shot generalization, whereas Uniform-noise Diffusion Language Models (UDLM) achieve strong few-step generation quality, yet neither attains balanced performance across both dimensions. To address this, we propose XDLM, which bridges the two paradigms via a stationary noise kernel. XDLM offers two key contributions: (1) it provides a principled theoretical unification of MDLM and UDLM, recovering each paradigm as a special case; and (2) an alleviated memory bottleneck enabled by an algebraic simplification of the posterior probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that XDLM advances the Pareto frontier between understanding capability and generation quality. Quantitatively, XDLM surpasses UDLM by 5.4 points on zero-shot text benchmarks and outperforms MDLM in few-step image generation (FID 54.1 vs. 80.8). When scaled to tune an 8B-parameter large language model, XDLM achieves 15.0 MBPP in just 32 steps, effectively doubling the baseline performance. Finally, analysis of training dynamics reveals XDLM's superior potential for long-term scaling. Code is available at https://github.com/MzeroMiko/XDLM]]></description>

While large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, the hardware and computational costs for training LLMs are also significantly burdensome. Among the state-of-the-art optimizers, AdamW relies on diagonal curvature estimates and ignores structural properties, while Muon applies global spectral normalization at the expense of losing curvature information. In this study, we restriked manifold optimization methods for training LLMs, which may address both optimizers' limitations, while conventional manifold optimization methods have been largely overlooked due to the poor performance in large-scale model optimization. By innovatively projecting the momentum onto the tangent space of model parameters and constraining it on a rotational Oblique manifold, we propose a novel, powerful, and efficient optimizer **Mano** that is the first to bridge the performance gap between manifold optimization and modern optimizers. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA and Qwen3 models demonstrate that Mano consistently and significantly outperforms AdamW and Muon even with less memory consumption and computational complexity, respectively, suggesting an expanded Pareto frontier in terms of space and time efficiency.]]></description>

This work stems from prior complementary observations on the dynamics of Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Large Language Models (LLMs) is shown latent planning of subsequent reasoning prior to CoT emergence, thereby diminishing the significance of explicit CoT; whereas CoT remains critical for tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. To deepen the understanding between LLM's internal states and its verbalized reasoning trajectories, we investigate the latent planning strength of LLMs, through our probing method, Tele-Lens, applying to hidden states across diverse task domains. Our empirical results indicate that LLMs exhibit a myopic horizon, primarily conducting incremental transitions without precise global planning. Leveraging this characteristic, we propose a hypothesis on enhancing uncertainty estimation of CoT, which we validate that a small subset of CoT positions can effectively represent the uncertainty of the entire path. We further underscore the significance of exploiting CoT dynamics, and demonstrate that automatic recognition of CoT bypass can be achieved without performance degradation. Our code, data and models are released at https://github.com/lxucs/tele-lens.]]></description>

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for accelerating scientific research. While models are increasingly capable of assisting with routine tasks, their ability to contribute to novel, expert-level mathematical discovery is less understood. We present a collection of case studies demonstrating how researchers have successfully collaborated with advanced AI models, specifically Google's Gemini-based models (in particular Gemini Deep Think and its advanced variants), to solve open problems, refute conjectures, and generate new proofs across diverse areas in theoretical computer science, as well as other areas such as economics, optimization, and physics. Based on these experiences, we extract common techniques for effective human-AI collaboration in theoretical research, such as iterative refinement, problem decomposition, and cross-disciplinary knowledge transfer. While the majority of our results stem from this interactive, conversational methodology, we also highlight specific instances that push beyond standard chat interfaces. These include deploying the model as a rigorous adversarial reviewer to detect subtle flaws in existing proofs, and embedding it within a "neuro-symbolic" loop that autonomously writes and executes code to verify complex derivations. Together, these examples highlight the potential of AI not just as a tool for automation, but as a versatile, genuine partner in the creative process of scientific discovery.]]></description>

Implicit neural representation (INR) has proven to be accurate and efficient in various domains. In this work, we explore how different neural networks can be designed as a new texture INR, which operates in a continuous manner rather than a discrete one over the input UV coordinate space. Through thorough experiments, we demonstrate that these INRs perform well in terms of image quality, with considerable memory usage and rendering inference time. We analyze the balance between these objectives. In addition, we investigate various related applications in real-time rendering and down-stream tasks, e.g. mipmap fitting and INR-space generation.]]></description>

We propose Parabolic Position Encoding (PaPE), a parabola-based position encoding for vision modalities in attention-based architectures. Given a set of vision tokens-such as images, point clouds, videos, or event camera streams-our objective is to encode their positions while accounting for the characteristics of vision modalities. Prior works have largely extended position encodings from 1D-sequences in language to nD-structures in vision, but only with partial account of vision characteristics. We address this gap by designing PaPE from principles distilled from prior work: translation invariance, rotation invariance (PaPE-RI), distance decay, directionality, and context awareness. We evaluate PaPE on 8 datasets that span 4 modalities. We find that either PaPE or PaPE-RI achieves the top performance on 7 out of 8 datasets. Extrapolation experiments on ImageNet-1K show that PaPE extrapolates remarkably well, improving in absolute terms by up to 10.5% over the next-best position encoding. Code is available at https://github.com/DTU-PAS/parabolic-position-encoding.]]></description>

World models have emerged as a critical frontier in AI research, aiming to enhance large models by infusing them with physical dynamics and world knowledge. The core objective is to enable agents to understand, predict, and interact with complex environments. However, current research landscape remains fragmented, with approaches predominantly focused on injecting world knowledge into isolated tasks, such as visual prediction, 3D estimation, or symbol grounding, rather than establishing a unified definition or framework. While these task-specific integrations yield performance gains, they often lack the systematic coherence required for holistic world understanding. In this paper, we analyze the limitations of such fragmented approaches and propose a unified design specification for world models. We suggest that a robust world model should not be a loose collection of capabilities but a normative framework that integrally incorporates interaction, perception, symbolic reasoning, and spatial representation. This work aims to provide a structured perspective to guide future research toward more general, robust, and principled models of the world.]]></description>

Introduction. AI Ethics is framed distinctly across actors and stakeholder groups. We report results from a case study of OpenAI analysing ethical AI discourse. Method. Research addressed: How has OpenAI's public discourse leveraged 'ethics', 'safety', 'alignment' and adjacent related concepts over time, and what does discourse signal about framing in practice? A structured corpus, differentiating between communication for a general audience and communication with an academic audience, was assembled from public documentation. Analysis. Qualitative content analysis of ethical themes combined inductively derived and deductively applied codes. Quantitative analysis leveraged computational content analysis methods via NLP to model topics and quantify changes in rhetoric over time. Visualizations report aggregate results. For reproducible results, we have released our code at https://github.com/famous-blue-raincoat/AI_Ethics_Discourse. Results. Results indicate that safety and risk discourse dominate OpenAI's public communication and documentation, without applying academic and advocacy ethics frameworks or vocabularies. Conclusions. Implications for governance are presented, along with discussion of ethics-washing practices in industry.]]></description>

Cross-lingual evaluation of large language models (LLMs) typically conflates two sources of variance: genuine model performance differences and measurement instability. We investigate evaluation reliability by holding generation conditions constant while varying target language. Using synthetic customer-support dialogues generated with identical parameters across Estonian, Finnish, and Hungarian, we test whether automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge scoring produce stable model rankings across these morphologically rich, related Finno-Ugric languages. With a small set of Estonian native speaker annotations as a reference point, we find systematic ranking instabilities: surface-level metrics (lexical diversity, surface and semantic similarity) maintain cross-language stability, but pragmatic judgments (coherence, instruction-following) exhibit rank inversions and near-zero correlations. Because generation is controlled, these inconsistencies reflect how judge scoring behaves differently across languages rather than true model differences.
  This controlled design provides a diagnostic probe: evaluation methods that fail to maintain stability under identical generation conditions signal transfer failure before deployment. Our findings suggest that zero-shot judge transfer is unreliable for discourse-level assessment in morphologically rich languages, motivating language-specific calibration against targeted human baselines. We release our controlled generation protocol, synthetic data, and evaluation framework to enable replication across language families at https://github.com/isaac-chung/cross-lingual-stability-judges.]]></description>

Modern deep learning-based inpainting enables realistic local image manipulation, raising critical challenges for reliable detection. However, we observe that current detectors primarily rely on global artifacts that appear as inpainting side effects, rather than on locally synthesized content. We show that this behavior occurs because VAE-based reconstruction induces a subtle but pervasive spectral shift across the entire image, including unedited regions. To isolate this effect, we introduce Inpainting Exchange (INP-X), an operation that restores original pixels outside the edited region while preserving all synthesized content. We create a 90K test dataset including real, inpainted, and exchanged images to evaluate this phenomenon. Under this intervention, pretrained state-of-the-art detectors, including commercial ones, exhibit a dramatic drop in accuracy (e.g., from 91\% to 55\%), frequently approaching chance level. We provide a theoretical analysis linking this behavior to high-frequency attenuation caused by VAE information bottlenecks. Our findings highlight the need for content-aware detection. Indeed, training on our dataset yields better generalization and localization than standard inpainting. Our dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/emirhanbilgic/INP-X.]]></description>

Event cameras offer a considerable alternative to RGB cameras in many scenarios. While there are recent works on event-based novel-view synthesis, dense 3D mesh reconstruction remains scarcely explored and existing event-based techniques are severely limited in their 3D reconstruction accuracy. To address this limitation, we present EventNeuS, a self-supervised neural model for learning 3D representations from monocular colour event streams. Our approach, for the first time, combines 3D signed distance function and density field learning with event-based supervision. Furthermore, we introduce spherical harmonics encodings into our model for enhanced handling of view-dependent effects. EventNeuS outperforms existing approaches by a significant margin, achieving 34% lower Chamfer distance and 31% lower mean absolute error on average compared to the best previous method.]]></description>

We develop a continual learning method for pretrained models that \emph{requires no access to old-task data}, addressing a practical barrier in foundation model adaptation where pretraining distributions are often unavailable. Our key observation is that pretrained networks exhibit substantial \emph{geometric redundancy}, and that this redundancy can be exploited in two complementary ways. First, redundant neurons provide a proxy for dominant pretraining-era feature directions, enabling the construction of approximately protected update subspaces directly from pretrained weights. Second, redundancy offers a natural bias for \emph{where} to place plasticity: by restricting updates to a subset of redundant neurons and constraining the remaining degrees of freedom, we obtain update families with reduced functional drift on the old-data distribution and improved worst-case retention guarantees. These insights lead to \textsc{PLATE} (\textbf{Pla}sticity-\textbf{T}unable \textbf{E}fficient Adapters), a continual learning method requiring no past-task data that provides explicit control over the plasticity-retention trade-off. PLATE parameterizes each layer with a structured low-rank update $ΔW = B A Q^\top$, where $B$ and $Q$ are computed once from pretrained weights and kept frozen, and only $A$ is trained on the new task. The code is available at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/PLATE.]]></description>

Designing effective quantum circuits remains a central challenge in quantum computing, as circuit structure strongly influences expressivity, trainability, and hardware feasibility. Current approaches, whether using manually designed circuit templates, fixed heuristics, or automated rules, face limitations in scalability, flexibility, and adaptability, often producing circuits that are poorly matched to the specific problem or quantum hardware. In this work, we propose the Evolutionary eXploration of Augmenting Quantum Circuits (EXAQC), an evolutionary approach to the automated design and training of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) which leverages and extends on strategies from neuroevolution and genetic programming. The proposed method jointly searches over gate types, qubit connectivity, parameterization, and circuit depth while respecting hardware and noise constraints. The method supports both Qiskit and Pennylane libraries, allowing the user to configure every aspect. This work highlights evolutionary search as a critical tool for advancing quantum machine learning and variational quantum algorithms, providing a principled pathway toward scalable, problem-aware, and hardware-efficient quantum circuit design. Preliminary results demonstrate that circuits evolved on classification tasks are able to achieve over 90% accuracy on most of the benchmark datasets with a limited computational budget, and are able to emulate target circuit quantum states with high fidelity scores.]]></description>

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a critical component for post-training large language models (LLMs). However, in bandwidth-constrained distributed RL, scalability is often bottlenecked by the synchronization of policy weights from trainers to inference workers, particularly over commodity networks or in decentralized settings. While recent studies suggest that RL updates modify only a small fraction of model parameters, these observations are typically based on coarse checkpoint differences. We present a systematic empirical study of weight-update sparsity at both step-level and multi-step granularities, examining its evolution across training dynamics, off-policy delay, and model scale. We find that update sparsity is consistently high, frequently exceeding 99% across practically relevant settings. Leveraging this structure, we propose PULSE (Patch Updates via Lossless Sparse Encoding), a simple yet highly efficient lossless weight synchronization method that transmits only the indices and values of modified parameters. PULSE is robust to transmission errors and avoids floating-point drift inherent in additive delta schemes. In bandwidth-constrained decentralized environments, our approach achieves over 100x (14 GB to ~108 MB) communication reduction while maintaining bit-identical training dynamics and performance compared to full weight synchronization. By exploiting this structure, PULSE enables decentralized RL training to approach centralized throughput, reducing the bandwidth required for weight synchronization from 20 Gbit/s to 0.2 Gbit/s to maintain high GPU utilization.]]></description>

In pre-production, filmmakers and 3D animation experts must rapidly prototype ideas to explore a film's possibilities before fullscale production, yet conventional approaches involve trade-offs in efficiency and expressiveness. Hand-drawn storyboards often lack spatial precision needed for complex cinematography, while 3D previsualization demands expertise and high-quality rigged assets. To address this gap, we present PrevizWhiz, a system that leverages rough 3D scenes in combination with generative image and video models to create stylized video previews. The workflow integrates frame-level image restyling with adjustable resemblance, time-based editing through motion paths or external video inputs, and refinement into high-fidelity video clips. A study with filmmakers demonstrates that our system lowers technical barriers for film-makers, accelerates creative iteration, and effectively bridges the communication gap, while also surfacing challenges of continuity, authorship, and ethical consideration in AI-assisted filmmaking.]]></description>

High-quality scientific illustrations are crucial for effectively communicating complex scientific and technical concepts, yet their manual creation remains a well-recognized bottleneck in both academia and industry. We present FigureBench, the first large-scale benchmark for generating scientific illustrations from long-form scientific texts. It contains 3,300 high-quality scientific text-figure pairs, covering diverse text-to-illustration tasks from scientific papers, surveys, blogs, and textbooks. Moreover, we propose AutoFigure, the first agentic framework that automatically generates high-quality scientific illustrations based on long-form scientific text. Specifically, before rendering the final result, AutoFigure engages in extensive thinking, recombination, and validation to produce a layout that is both structurally sound and aesthetically refined, outputting a scientific illustration that achieves both structural completeness and aesthetic appeal. Leveraging the high-quality data from FigureBench, we conduct extensive experiments to test the performance of AutoFigure against various baseline methods. The results demonstrate that AutoFigure consistently surpasses all baseline methods, producing publication-ready scientific illustrations. The code, dataset and huggingface space are released in https://github.com/ResearAI/AutoFigure.]]></description>

Diffusion-based editing models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic image and video manipulation. However, existing models lack a mechanism for smoothly controlling the intensity of text-guided edits. In standard text-conditioned generation, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) impacts prompt adherence, suggesting it as a potential control for edit intensity in editing models. However, we show that scaling CFG in these models does not produce a smooth transition between the input and the edited result. We attribute this behavior to the unconditional prediction, which serves as the guidance origin and dominates the generation at low guidance scales, while representing an arbitrary manipulation of the input content. To enable continuous control, we introduce Adaptive-Origin Guidance (AdaOr), a method that adjusts this standard guidance origin with an identity-conditioned adaptive origin, using an identity instruction corresponding to the identity manipulation. By interpolating this identity prediction with the standard unconditional prediction according to the edit strength, we ensure a continuous transition from the input to the edited result. We evaluate our method on image and video editing tasks, demonstrating that it provides smoother and more consistent control compared to current slider-based editing approaches. Our method incorporates an identity instruction into the standard training framework, enabling fine-grained control at inference time without per-edit procedure or reliance on specialized datasets.]]></description>

Human interventions are a common source of data in autonomous systems during testing. These interventions provide an important signal about where the current policy needs improvement, but are often noisy and incomplete. We define Robust Intervention Learning (RIL) as the problem of learning from intervention data while remaining robust to the quality and informativeness of the intervention signal. In the best case, interventions are precise and avoiding them is sufficient to solve the task, but in many realistic settings avoiding interventions is necessary but not sufficient for achieving good performance. We study robust intervention learning in the context of emergency stop interventions and propose Residual Intervention Fine-Tuning (RIFT), a residual fine-tuning algorithm that treats intervention feedback as an incomplete learning signal and explicitly combines it with a prior policy. By framing intervention learning as a fine-tuning problem, our approach leverages structure encoded in the prior policy to resolve ambiguity when intervention signals under-specify the task. We provide theoretical analysis characterizing conditions under which this formulation yields principled policy improvement, and identify regimes where intervention learning is expected to fail. Our experiments reveal that residual fine-tuning enables robust and consistent policy improvement across a range of intervention strategies and prior policy qualities, and highlight robust intervention learning as a promising direction for future work.]]></description>

The evolution of biological morphology is critical for understanding the diversity of the natural world, yet traditional analyses often involve subjective biases in the selection and coding of morphological traits. This study employs deep learning techniques, utilising a ResNet34 model capable of recognising over 10,000 bird species, to explore avian morphological evolution. We extract weights from the model's final fully connected (fc) layer and investigate the semantic alignment between the high-dimensional embedding space learned by the model and biological phenotypes. The results demonstrate that the high-dimensional embedding space encodes phenotypic convergence. Subsequently, we assess the morphological disparity among various taxa and evaluate the association between morphological disparity and species richness, demonstrating that species richness is the primary driver of morphospace expansion. Moreover, the disparity-through-time analysis reveals a visual "early burst" after the K-Pg extinction.
  While mainly aimed at evolutionary analysis, this study also provides insights into the interpretability of Deep Neural Networks. We demonstrate that hierarchical semantic structures (biological taxonomy) emerged in the high-dimensional embedding space despite being trained on flat labels. Furthermore, through adversarial examples, we provide evidence that our model in this task can overcome texture bias and learn holistic shape representations (body plans), challenging the prevailing view that CNNs rely primarily on local textures.]]></description>

We introduce a new preference-based framework for conditional treatment effect estimation and policy learning, built on the Conditional Preference-based Treatment Effect (CPTE). CPTE requires only that outcomes be ranked under a preference rule, unlocking flexible modeling of heterogeneous effects with multivariate, ordinal, or preference-driven outcomes. This unifies applications such as conditional probability of necessity and sufficiency, conditional Win Ratio, and Generalized Pairwise Comparisons. Despite the intrinsic non-identifiability of comparison-based estimands, CPTE provides interpretable targets and delivers new identifiability conditions for previous unidentifiable estimands. We present estimation strategies via matching, quantile, and distributional regression, and further design efficient influence-function estimators to correct plug-in bias and maximize policy value. Synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments demonstrate clear performance gains and practical impact.]]></description>

Meme-based social abuse detection is challenging because harmful intent often relies on implicit cultural symbolism and subtle cross-modal incongruence. Prior approaches, from fusion-based methods to in-context learning with Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), have made progress but remain limited by three factors: i) cultural blindness (missing symbolic context), ii) boundary ambiguity (satire vs. abuse confusion), and iii) lack of interpretability (opaque model reasoning). We introduce CROSS-ALIGN+, a three-stage framework that systematically addresses these limitations: (1) Stage I mitigates cultural blindness by enriching multimodal representations with structured knowledge from ConceptNet, Wikidata, and Hatebase; (2) Stage II reduces boundary ambiguity through parameter-efficient LoRA adapters that sharpen decision boundaries; and (3) Stage III enhances interpretability by generating cascaded explanations. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks and eight LVLMs demonstrate that CROSS-ALIGN+ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 17% relative F1 improvement while providing interpretable justifications for each decision.]]></description>

We propose SymPlex, a reinforcement learning framework for discovering analytical symbolic solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) without access to ground-truth expressions. SymPlex formulates symbolic PDE solving as tree-structured decision-making and optimizes candidate solutions using only the PDE and its boundary conditions. At its core is SymFormer, a structure-aware Transformer that models hierarchical symbolic dependencies via tree-relative self-attention and enforces syntactic validity through grammar-constrained autoregressive decoding, overcoming the limited expressivity of sequence-based generators. Unlike numerical and neural approaches that approximate solutions in discretized or implicit function spaces, SymPlex operates directly in symbolic expression space, enabling interpretable and human-readable solutions that naturally represent non-smooth behavior and explicit parametric dependence. Empirical results demonstrate exact recovery of non-smooth and parametric PDE solutions using deep learning-based symbolic methods.]]></description>

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from severe training inefficiency issue, which is associated with their massive model sizes and visual token numbers. Existing efforts in efficient training focus on reducing model sizes or trainable parameters. Inspired by the success of Visual Token Pruning (VTP) in improving inference efficiency, we are exploring another substantial research direction for efficient training by reducing visual tokens. However, applying VTP at the training stage results in a training-inference mismatch: pruning-trained models perform poorly when inferring on non-pruned full visual token sequences. To close this gap, we propose DualSpeed, a fast-slow framework for efficient training of MLLMs. The fast-mode is the primary mode, which incorporates existing VTP methods as plugins to reduce visual tokens, along with a mode isolator to isolate the model's behaviors. The slow-mode is the auxiliary mode, where the model is trained on full visual sequences to retain training-inference consistency. To boost its training, it further leverages self-distillation to learn from the sufficiently trained fast-mode. Together, DualSpeed can achieve both training efficiency and non-degraded performance. Experiments show DualSpeed accelerates the training of LLaVA-1.5 by 2.1$\times$ and LLaVA-NeXT by 4.0$\times$, retaining over 99% performance.

Reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) enable test-time scaling, with dataset-level accuracy improving as the token budget increases, motivating adaptive reasoning -- spending tokens when they improve reliability and stopping early when additional computation is unlikely to help. However, setting the token budget, as well as the threshold for adaptive reasoning, is a practical challenge that entails a fundamental risk-accuracy trade-off. We re-frame the budget setting problem as risk control, limiting the error rate while minimizing compute. Our framework introduces an upper threshold that stops reasoning when the model is confident (risking incorrect output) and a novel parametric lower threshold that preemptively stops unsolvable instances (risking premature stoppage). Given a target risk and a validation set, we use distribution-free risk control to optimally specify these stopping mechanisms. For scenarios with multiple budget controlling criteria, we incorporate an efficiency loss to select the most computationally efficient exiting mechanism. Empirical results across diverse reasoning tasks and models demonstrate the effectiveness of our risk control approach, demonstrating computational efficiency gains from the lower threshold and ensemble stopping mechanisms while adhering to the user-specified risk target.]]></description>

Model distillation enables efficient emulation of frontier large language models (LLMs), creating a need for robust mechanisms to detect when a third-party student model has trained on a teacher model's outputs. However, existing fingerprinting techniques that could be used to detect such distillation rely on heuristic perturbations that impose a steep trade-off between generation quality and fingerprinting strength, often requiring significant degradation of utility to ensure the fingerprint is effectively internalized by the student. We introduce antidistillation fingerprinting (ADFP), a principled approach that aligns the fingerprinting objective with the student's learning dynamics. Building upon the gradient-based framework of antidistillation sampling, ADFP utilizes a proxy model to identify and sample tokens that directly maximize the expected detectability of the fingerprint in the student after fine-tuning, rather than relying on the incidental absorption of the un-targeted biases of a more naive watermark. Experiments on GSM8K and OASST1 benchmarks demonstrate that ADFP achieves a significant Pareto improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, yielding stronger detection confidence with minimal impact on utility, even when the student model's architecture is unknown.]]></description>

A key challenge in autoregressive image generation is to efficiently sample independent locations in parallel, while still modeling mutual dependencies with serial conditioning. Some recent works have addressed this by conditioning between scales in a multiscale pyramid. Others have looked at parallelizing samples in a single image using regular partitions or randomized orders. In this work we examine a flexible, fixed ordering based on progressive checkerboards for multiscale autoregressive image generation. Our ordering draws samples in parallel from evenly spaced regions at each scale, maintaining full balance in all levels of a quadtree subdivision at each step. This enables effective conditioning both between and within scales. Intriguingly, we find evidence that in our balanced setting, a wide range of scale-up factors lead to similar results, so long as the total number of serial steps is constant. On class-conditional ImageNet, our method achieves competitive performance compared to recent state-of-the-art autoregressive systems with like model capacity, using fewer sampling steps.]]></description>

Imbalanced node classification in graph neural networks (GNNs) happens when some labels are much more common than others, which causes the model to learn unfairly and perform badly on the less common classes. To solve this problem, we propose a Curriculum-Guided Feature Learning and Three-Stage Attention Network (CL3AN-GNN), a learning network that uses a three-step attention system (Engage, Enact, Embed) similar to how humans learn. The model begins by engaging with structurally simpler features, defined as (1) local neighbourhood patterns (1-hop), (2) low-degree node attributes, and (3) class-separable node pairs identified via initial graph convolutional networks and graph attention networks (GCN and GAT) embeddings. This foundation enables stable early learning despite label skew. The Enact stage then addresses complicated aspects: (1) connections that require multiple steps, (2) edges that connect different types of nodes, and (3) nodes at the edges of minority classes by using adjustable attention weights. Finally, Embed consolidates these features via iterative message passing and curriculum-aligned loss weighting. We evaluate CL3AN-GNN on eight Open Graph Benchmark datasets spanning social, biological, and citation networks. Experiments show consistent improvements across all datasets in accuracy, F1-score, and AUC over recent state-of-the-art methods. The model's step-by-step method works well with different types of graph datasets, showing quicker results than training everything at once, better performance on new, imbalanced graphs, and clear explanations of each step using gradient stability and attention correlation learning curves. This work provides both a theoretically grounded framework for curriculum learning in GNNs and practical evidence of its effectiveness against imbalances, validated through metrics, convergence speeds, and generalisation tests.]]></description>

Recently, there have been significant research interests in training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) on real-world tasks, such as multi-turn code generation. While online RL tends to perform better than offline RL, its higher training cost and instability hinders wide adoption. In this paper, we build on the observation that multi-turn code generation can be formulated as a one-step recoverable Markov decision process and propose contextual bandit learning with offline trajectories (Cobalt), a new method that combines the benefits of online and offline RL. Cobalt first collects code generation trajectories using a reference LLM and divides them into partial trajectories as contextual prompts. Then, during online bandit learning, the LLM is trained to complete each partial trajectory prompt through single-step code generation. Cobalt outperforms two multi-turn online RL baselines based on GRPO and VeRPO, and substantially improves R1-Distill 8B and Qwen3 8B by up to 9.0 and 6.2 absolute Pass@1 scores on LiveCodeBench. Also, we analyze LLMs' in-context reward hacking behaviors and augment Cobalt training with perturbed trajectories to mitigate this issue. Overall, our results demonstrate Cobalt as a promising solution for iterative decision-making tasks like multi-turn code generation. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/cobalt.]]></description>

The prediction of critical heat flux (CHF) using machine learning (ML) approaches has become a highly active research activity in recent years, the goal of which is to build models more accurate than current conventional approaches such as empirical correlations or lookup tables (LUTs). Previous work developed and deployed tube-based pure and hybrid ML models in the CTF subchannel code, however, full-scale reactor core simulations require the use of rod bundle geometries. Unlike isolated subchannels, rod bundles experience complex thermal hydraulic phenomena such as channel crossflow, spacer grid losses, and effects from unheated conductors. This study investigates the generalization of ML-based CHF prediction models in rod bundles after being trained on tube-based CHF data. A purely data-driven DNN and two hybrid bias-correction models were implemented in the CTF subchannel code and used to predict CHF location and magnitude in the Combustion Engineering 5-by-5 bundle CHF test series. The W-3 correlation, Bowring correlation, and Groeneveld LUT were used as baseline comparators. On average, all three ML-based approaches produced magnitude and location predictions more accurate than the baseline models, with the hybrid LUT model exhibiting the most favorable performance metrics.]]></description>

Modern distributed optimization methods mostly rely on traditional synchronous approaches, despite substantial recent progress in asynchronous optimization. We revisit Synchronous SGD and its robust variant, called $m$-Synchronous SGD, and theoretically show that they are nearly optimal in many heterogeneous computation scenarios, which is somewhat unexpected. We analyze the synchronous methods under random computation times and adversarial partial participation of workers, and prove that their time complexities are optimal in many practical regimes, up to logarithmic factors. While synchronous methods are not universal solutions and there exist tasks where asynchronous methods may be necessary, we show that they are sufficient for many modern heterogeneous computation scenarios.]]></description>

Designing provably safe control is a core problem in trustworthy autonomy. However, most prior work in this regard assumes either that the system dynamics are known or deterministic, or that the state and action space are finite, significantly limiting application scope. We address this limitation by developing a probabilistic verification framework for unknown dynamical systems which combines conformal prediction with reachability analysis. In particular, we use conformal prediction to obtain valid uncertainty intervals for the unknown dynamics at each time step, with reachability then verifying whether safety is maintained within the conformal uncertainty bounds. Next, we develop an algorithmic approach for training control policies that optimize nominal reward while also maximizing the planning horizon with sound probabilistic safety guarantees. We evaluate the proposed approach in seven safe control settings spanning four domains -- cartpole, lane following, drone control, and safe navigation -- for both affine and nonlinear safety specifications. Our experiments show that the policies we learn achieve the strongest provable safety guarantees while still maintaining high average reward.]]></description>

Assisting non-expert users to develop complex interactive websites has become a popular task for LLM-powered code agents. However, existing code agents tend to only generate frontend web pages, masking the lack of real full-stack data processing and storage with fancy visual effects. Notably, constructing production-level full-stack web applications is far more challenging than only generating frontend web pages, demanding careful control of data flow, comprehensive understanding of constantly updating packages and dependencies, and accurate localization of obscure bugs in the codebase. To address these difficulties, we introduce FullStack-Agent, a unified agent system for full-stack agentic coding that consists of three parts: (1) FullStack-Dev, a multi-agent framework with strong planning, code editing, codebase navigation, and bug localization abilities. (2) FullStack-Learn, an innovative data-scaling and self-improving method that back-translates crawled and synthesized website repositories to improve the backbone LLM of FullStack-Dev. (3) FullStack-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically tests the frontend, backend and database functionalities of the generated website. Our FullStack-Dev outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 8.7%, 38.2%, and 15.9% on the frontend, backend, and database test cases respectively. Additionally, FullStack-Learn raises the performance of a 30B model by 9.7%, 9.5%, and 2.8% on the three sets of test cases through self-improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. The code is released at https://github.com/mnluzimu/FullStack-Agent.]]></description>

We present a new paradigm for creating random features to approximate bi-variate functions (in particular, kernels) defined on general manifolds. This new mechanism of Manifold Random Features (MRFs) leverages discretization of the manifold and the recently introduced technique of Graph Random Features (GRFs) to learn continuous fields on manifolds. Those fields are used to find continuous approximation mechanisms that otherwise, in general scenarios, cannot be derived analytically. MRFs provide positive and bounded features, a key property for accurate, low-variance approximation. We show deep asymptotic connection between GRFs, defined on discrete graph objects, and continuous random features used for regular kernels. As a by-product of our method, we re-discover recently introduced mechanism of Gaussian kernel approximation applied in particular to improve linear-attention Transformers, considering simple random walks on graphs and by-passing original complex mathematical computations. We complement our algorithm with a rigorous theoretical analysis and verify in thorough experimental studies.]]></description>

LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a promising approach to tackle complex tasks that are difficult for individual LLMs. A natural strategy is to scale performance by increasing the number of agents; however, we find that such scaling exhibits strong diminishing returns in homogeneous settings, while introducing heterogeneity (e.g., different models, prompts, or tools) continues to yield substantial gains. This raises a fundamental question: what limits scaling, and why does diversity help? We present an information-theoretic framework showing that MAS performance is bounded by the intrinsic task uncertainty, not by agent count. We derive architecture-agnostic bounds demonstrating that improvements depend on how many effective channels the system accesses. Homogeneous agents saturate early because their outputs are strongly correlated, whereas heterogeneous agents contribute complementary evidence. We further introduce $K^*$, an effective channel count that quantifies the number of effective channels without ground-truth labels. Empirically, we show that heterogeneous configurations consistently outperform homogeneous scaling: 2 diverse agents can match or exceed the performance of 16 homogeneous agents. Our results provide principled guidelines for building efficient and robust MAS through diversity-aware design.

Embodied world models have emerged as a promising paradigm in robotics, most of which leverage large-scale Internet videos or pretrained video generation models to enrich visual and motion priors. However, they still face key challenges: a misalignment between coordinate-space actions and pixel-space videos, sensitivity to camera viewpoint, and non-unified architectures across embodiments. To this end, we present BridgeV2W, which converts coordinate-space actions into pixel-aligned embodiment masks rendered from the URDF and camera parameters. These masks are then injected into a pretrained video generation model via a ControlNet-style pathway, which aligns the action control signals with predicted videos, adds view-specific conditioning to accommodate camera viewpoints, and yields a unified world model architecture across embodiments. To mitigate overfitting to static backgrounds, BridgeV2W further introduces a flow-based motion loss that focuses on learning dynamic and task-relevant regions. Experiments on single-arm (DROID) and dual-arm (AgiBot-G1) datasets, covering diverse and challenging conditions with unseen viewpoints and scenes, show that BridgeV2W improves video generation quality compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. We further demonstrate the potential of BridgeV2W on downstream real-world tasks, including policy evaluation and goal-conditioned planning.

Prompt injection attacks manipulate webpage content to cause web agents to execute attacker-specified tasks instead of the user's intended ones. Existing methods for detecting and localizing such attacks achieve limited effectiveness, as their underlying assumptions often do not hold in the web-agent setting. In this work, we propose WebSentinel, a two-step approach for detecting and localizing prompt injection attacks in webpages. Given a webpage, Step I extracts \emph{segments of interest} that may be contaminated, and Step II evaluates each segment by checking its consistency with the webpage content as context. We show that WebSentinel is highly effective, substantially outperforming baseline methods across multiple datasets of both contaminated and clean webpages that we collected. Our code is available at: https://github.com/wxl-lxw/WebSentinel.]]></description>

Recent advances in generative modelling have led many to see synthetic data as the go-to solution for a range of problems around data access, scarcity, and under-representation. In this paper, we study three prominent use cases: (1) Sharing synthetic data as a proxy for proprietary datasets to enable statistical analyses while protecting privacy, (2) Augmenting machine learning training sets with synthetic data to improve model performance, and (3) Augmenting datasets with synthetic data to reduce variance in statistical estimation. For each use case, we formalise the problem setting and study, through formal analysis and case studies, under which conditions synthetic data can achieve its intended objectives. We identify fundamental and practical limits that constrain when synthetic data can serve as an effective solution for a particular problem. Our analysis reveals that due to these limits many existing or envisioned use cases of synthetic data are a poor problem fit. Our formalisations and classification of synthetic data use cases enable decision makers to assess whether synthetic data is a suitable approach for their specific data availability problem.]]></description>

Stochastic interpolants unify flows and diffusions, popular generative modeling frameworks. A primary hyperparameter in these methods is the interpolation schedule that determines how to bridge a standard Gaussian base measure to an arbitrary target measure. We prove how to convert a sample path of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) with arbitrary diffusion coefficient under any schedule into the unique sample path under another arbitrary schedule and diffusion coefficient. We then extend the stochastic interpolant framework to admit a larger class of point mass schedules in which the Gaussian base measure collapses to a point mass measure. Under the assumption of Gaussian data, we identify lazy schedule families that make the drift identically zero and show that with deterministic sampling one gets a variance-preserving schedule commonly used in diffusion models, whereas with statistically optimal SDE sampling one gets our point mass schedule. Finally, to demonstrate the usefulness of our theoretical results on realistic highly non-Gaussian data, we apply our lazy schedule conversion to a state-of-the-art pretrained flow model and show that this allows for generating images in fewer steps without retraining the model.]]></description>

Machine unlearning is the process of efficiently removing specific information from a trained machine learning model without retraining from scratch. Existing unlearning methods, which often provide provable guarantees, typically involve retraining a subset of model parameters based on a forget set. While these approaches show promise in certain scenarios, their underlying assumptions are often challenged in real-world applications -- particularly when applied to generative models. Furthermore, updating parameters using these unlearning procedures often degrades the general-purpose capabilities the model acquired during pre-training. Motivated by these shortcomings, this paper considers the paradigm of inference time unlearning -- wherein, the generative model is equipped with an (approximately correct) verifier that judges whether the model's response satisfies appropriate unlearning guarantees. This paper introduces a framework that iteratively refines the quality of the generated responses using feedback from the verifier without updating the model parameters. The proposed framework leverages conformal prediction to reduce computational overhead and provide distribution-free unlearning guarantees. This paper's approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, reducing unlearning error by up to 93% across challenging unlearning benchmarks.]]></description>

Language agents have shown strong promise for task automation. Realizing this promise for increasingly complex, long-horizon tasks has driven the rise of a sub-agent-as-tools paradigm for multi-turn task solving. However, existing designs still lack a dynamic abstraction view of sub-agents, thereby hurting adaptability. We address this challenge with a unified, framework-agnostic agent abstraction that models any agent as a tuple Instruction, Context, Tools, Model. This tuple acts as a compositional recipe for capabilities, enabling the system to spawn specialized executors for each task on demand. Building on this abstraction, we introduce an agentic system AOrchestra, where the central orchestrator concretizes the tuple at each step: it curates task-relevant context, selects tools and models, and delegates execution via on-the-fly automatic agent creation. Such designs enable reducing human engineering efforts, and remain framework-agnostic with plug-and-play support for diverse agents as task executors. It also enables a controllable performance-cost trade-off, allowing the system to approach Pareto-efficient. Across three challenging benchmarks (GAIA, SWE-Bench, Terminal-Bench), AOrchestra achieves 16.28% relative improvement against the strongest baseline when paired with Gemini-3-Flash.

Introduction: In neurosurgery, image-guided Neurosurgery Systems (IGNS) highly rely on preoperative brain magnetic resonance images (MRI) to assist surgeons in locating surgical targets and determining surgical paths. However, brain shift invalidates the preoperative MRI after dural opening. Updated intraoperative brain MRI with brain shift compensation is crucial for enhancing the precision of neuronavigation systems and ensuring the optimal outcome of surgical interventions. Methodology: We propose NeuralShift, a U-Net-based model that predicts brain shift entirely from pre-operative MRI for patients undergoing temporal lobe resection. We evaluated our results using Target Registration Errors (TREs) computed on anatomical landmarks located on the resection side and along the midline, and DICE scores comparing predicted intraoperative masks with masks derived from intraoperative MRI. Results: Our experimental results show that our model can predict the global deformation of the brain (DICE of 0.97) with accurate local displacements (achieve landmark TRE as low as 1.12 mm), compensating for large brain shifts during temporal lobe removal neurosurgery. Conclusion: Our proposed model is capable of predicting the global deformation of the brain during temporal lobe resection using only preoperative images, providing potential opportunities to the surgical team to increase safety and efficiency of neurosurgery and better outcomes to patients. Our contributions will be publicly available after acceptance in https://github.com/SurgicalDataScienceKCL/NeuralShift.]]></description>

Long-context inference with Large Language Models (LLMs) is costly due to quadratic attention and growing key-value caches, motivating context compression. In this work, we study soft context compression, where a long context is condensed into a small set of continuous representations. Existing methods typically re-purpose the LLM itself as a trainable compressor, relying on layer-by-layer self-attention to iteratively aggregate information. We argue that this paradigm suffers from two structural limitations: (i) progressive representation overwriting across layers (ii) uncoordinated allocation of compression capacity across tokens. We propose ComprExIT (Context Compression via Explicit Information Transmission), a lightweight framework that formulates soft compression into a new paradigm: explicit information transmission over frozen LLM hidden states. This decouples compression from the model's internal self-attention dynamics. ComprExIT performs (i) depth-wise transmission to selectively transmit multi-layer information into token anchors, mitigating progressive overwriting, and (ii) width-wise transmission to aggregate anchors into a small number of slots via a globally optimized transmission plan, ensuring coordinated allocation of information. Across six question-answering benchmarks, ComprExIT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art context compression methods while introducing only ~1% additional parameters, demonstrating that explicit and coordinated information transmission enables more effective and robust long-context compression.]]></description>

Modern AI agents such as large language models are trained on diverse tasks -- translation, code generation, mathematical reasoning, and text prediction -- simultaneously. A key question is to quantify how each individual training task influences performance on a target task, a problem we refer to as task attribution. The direct approach, leave-one-out retraining, measures the effect of removing each task, but is computationally infeasible at scale. An alternative approach that builds surrogate models to predict a target task's performance for any subset of training tasks has emerged in recent literature. Prior work focuses on linear surrogate models, which capture first-order relationships, but miss nonlinear interactions such as synergy, antagonism, or XOR-type effects. In this paper, we first consider a unified task weighting framework for analyzing task attribution methods, and show a new connection between linear surrogate models and influence functions through a second-order analysis. Then, we introduce kernel surrogate models, which more effectively represent second-order task interactions. To efficiently learn the kernel surrogate, we develop a gradient-based estimation procedure that leverages a first-order approximation of pretrained models; empirically, this yields accurate estimates with less than $2\%$ relative error without repeated retraining. Experiments across multiple domains -- including math reasoning in transformers, in-context learning, and multi-objective reinforcement learning -- demonstrate the effectiveness of kernel surrogate models. They achieve a $25\%$ higher correlation with the leave-one-out ground truth than linear surrogates and influence-function baselines. When used for downstream task selection, kernel surrogate models yield a $40\%$ improvement in demonstration selection for in-context learning and multi-objective reinforcement learning benchmarks.]]></description>

The advent of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represents a significant leap for embodied intelligence, yet their immense computational demands critically hinder deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms. Intuitively, low-bit quantization is a prevalent and preferred technique for large-scale model compression. However, we find that a systematic analysis of VLA model's quantization is fundamentally lacking. We argue that naively applying uniform-bit quantization from Large Language Models (LLMs) to robotics is flawed, as these methods prioritize passive data fidelity while ignoring how minor action deviations compound into catastrophic task failures. To bridge this gap, we introduce QVLA, the first action-centric quantization framework specifically designed for embodied control. In a sharp departure from the rigid, uniform-bit quantization of LLM-based methods, QVLA introduces a highly granular, channel-wise bit allocation strategy. Its core mechanism is to directly measure the final action-space sensitivity when quantizing each individual channel to various bit-widths. This process yields a precise, per-channel importance metric that guides a global optimization, which elegantly unifies quantization and pruning (0-bit) into a single, cohesive framework. Extensive evaluations on different baselines demonstrate the superiority of our approach. In the LIBERO, the quantization version of OpenVLA-OFT with our method requires only 29.2% of the original model's VRAM while maintaining 98.9% of its original performance and achieving a 1.49x speedup. This translates to a 22.6% performance improvement over the LLM-derived method SmoothQuant. Our work establishes a new, principled foundation for compressing VLA models in robotics, paving the way for deploying powerful, large-scale models on real-world hardware. Code will be released.]]></description>

Tail-end risk measures such as static conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) are used in safety-critical applications to prevent rare, yet catastrophic events. Unlike risk-neutral objectives, the static CVaR of the return depends on entire trajectories without admitting a recursive Bellman decomposition in the underlying Markov decision process. A classical resolution relies on state augmentation with a continuous variable. However, unless restricted to a specialized class of admissible value functions, this formulation induces sparse rewards and degenerate fixed points. In this work, we propose a novel formulation of the static CVaR objective based on augmentation. Our alternative approach leads to a Bellman operator with: (1) dense per-step rewards; (2) contracting properties on the full space of bounded value functions. Building on this theoretical foundation, we develop risk-averse value iteration and model-free Q-learning algorithms that rely on discretized augmented states. We further provide convergence guarantees and approximation error bounds due to discretization. Empirical results demonstrate that our algorithms successfully learn CVaR-sensitive policies and achieve effective performance-safety trade-offs.]]></description>

Modern generative models for limit order books (LOBs) can reproduce realistic market dynamics, but remain fundamentally passive: they either model what typically happens without accounting for hypothetical future market conditions, or they require interaction with another agent to explore alternative outcomes. This limits their usefulness for stress testing, scenario analysis, and decision-making. We propose \textbf{DiffLOB}, a regime-conditioned \textbf{Diff}usion model for controllable and counterfactual generation of \textbf{LOB} trajectories. DiffLOB explicitly conditions the generative process on future market regimes--including trend, volatility, liquidity, and order-flow imbalance, which enables the model to answer counterfactual queries of the form: ``If the future market regime were X instead of Y, how would the limit order book evolve?'' Our systematic evaluation framework for counterfactual LOB generation consists of three criteria: (1) \textit{Controllable Realism}, measuring how well generated trajectories can reproduce marginal distributions, temporal dependence structure and regime variables; (2) \textit{Counterfactual validity}, testing whether interventions on future regimes induce consistent changes in the generated LOB dynamics; (3) \textit{Counterfactual usefulness}, assessing whether synthetic counterfactual trajectories improve downstream prediction of future market regimes.]]></description>

Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly mediate our social, cultural, and political interactions. While they can simulate some aspects of human behavior and decision-making, it is still underexplored whether repeated interactions with other agents amplify their biases or lead to exclusionary behaviors. To this end, we study Chirper.ai-an LLM-driven social media platform-analyzing 7M posts and interactions among 32K LLM agents over a year. We start with homophily and social influence among LLMs, learning that similar to humans', their social networks exhibit these fundamental phenomena. Next, we study the toxic language of LLMs, its linguistic features, and their interaction patterns, finding that LLMs show different structural patterns in toxic posting than humans. After studying the ideological leaning in LLMs posts, and the polarization in their community, we focus on how to prevent their potential harmful activities. We present a simple yet effective method, called Chain of Social Thought (CoST), that reminds LLM agents to avoid harmful posting.]]></description>

Large Language Models (LLMs) that can continually improve beyond their training budgets are able to solve increasingly difficult problems by adapting at test time, a property we refer to as extrapolation. However, standard reinforcement learning (RL) operates over fixed problem distributions and training budgets, which limits extrapolation amidst distribution shift at test time. To address this, we introduce RC, an iterative decoding algorithm that replaces standard autoregressive decoding during both training and inference. RC exploits an asymmetry between the response generation and summarization capabilities of LLMs to construct reasoning chains that consistently improve across iterations. Models trained to use RC can extrapolate and continually improve over reasoning horizons more than an order of magnitude longer than those seen during training. Empirically, training a 4B model with RC using a 16k-token training budget improves performance on HMMT 2025 from 40% to nearly 70% with 0.5m tokens at test time, outperforming both comparably sized models and many larger reasoning LLMs. Finally, we also show that models trained with RC can more effectively leverage existing scaffolds to further scale test-time performance, due to the improved summary-conditioned generation abilities learned through training.]]></description>

The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly limited by data quality. Most methods handle data mixing and sample selection separately, which can break the structure in code corpora. We introduce \textbf{UniGeM}, a framework that unifies mixing and selection by treating data curation as a \textit{manifold approximation} problem without training proxy models or relying on external reference datasets. UniGeM operates hierarchically: \textbf{Macro-Exploration} learns mixing weights with stability-based clustering; \textbf{Micro-Mining} filters high-quality instances by their geometric distribution to ensure logical consistency. Validated by training 8B and 16B MoE models on 100B tokens, UniGeM achieves \textbf{2.0$\times$ data efficiency} over a random baseline and further improves overall performance compared to SOTA methods in reasoning-heavy evaluations and multilingual generalization.]]></description>

Discrete diffusion models have recently become competitive with autoregressive models for language modeling, even outperforming them on reasoning tasks requiring planning and global coherence, but they require more computation at inference time. We trace this trade-off to a key mechanism: diffusion models are trained to jointly predict a distribution over all unknown tokens, including those that will not actually be decoded in the current step. Ablating this joint prediction yields faster inference but degrades performance, revealing that accurate prediction at the decoded position relies on joint reasoning about the distribution of undecoded tokens. We interpret these as latent tokens and introduce a method for modulating their number, demonstrating empirically that this enables a smooth tradeoff between inference speed and sample quality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that latent tokens can be introduced into autoregressive models through an auxiliary multi-token prediction objective, yielding substantial improvements on the same reasoning tasks where they have traditionally struggled. Our results suggest that latent tokens, while arising naturally in diffusion, represent a general mechanism for improving performance on tasks requiring global coherence or lookahead.]]></description>

Artificial intelligence weather prediction (AIWP) models now often outperform traditional physics-based models on common metrics while requiring orders-of-magnitude less computing resources and time. Open-access AIWP models thus hold promise as transformational tools for helping low- and middle-income populations make decisions in the face of high-impact weather shocks. Yet, current approaches to evaluating AIWP models focus mainly on aggregated meteorological metrics without considering local stakeholders' needs in decision-oriented, operational frameworks. Here, we introduce such a framework that connects meteorology, AI, and social sciences. As an example, we apply it to the 150-year-old problem of Indian monsoon forecasting, focusing on benefits to rain-fed agriculture, which is highly susceptible to climate change. AIWP models skillfully predict an agriculturally relevant onset index at regional scales weeks in advance when evaluated out-of-sample using deterministic and probabilistic metrics. This framework informed a government-led effort in 2025 to send 38 million Indian farmers AI-based monsoon onset forecasts, which captured an unusual weeks-long pause in monsoon progression. This decision-oriented benchmarking framework provides a key component of a blueprint for harnessing the power of AIWP models to help large vulnerable populations adapt to weather shocks in the face of climate variability and change.]]></description>

Human vision is foveated, with variable resolution peaking at the center of a large field of view; this reflects an efficient trade-off for active sensing, allowing eye-movements to bring different parts of the world into focus with other parts of the world in context. In contrast, most computer vision systems encode the visual world at a uniform resolution, raising challenges for processing full-field high-resolution images efficiently. We propose a foveated vision interface (FOVI) based on the human retina and primary visual cortex, that reformats a variable-resolution retina-like sensor array into a uniformly dense, V1-like sensor manifold. Receptive fields are defined as k-nearest-neighborhoods (kNNs) on the sensor manifold, enabling kNN-convolution via a novel kernel mapping technique. We demonstrate two use cases: (1) an end-to-end kNN-convolutional architecture, and (2) a foveated adaptation of the foundational DINOv3 ViT model, leveraging low-rank adaptation (LoRA). These models provide competitive performance at a fraction of the computational cost of non-foveated baselines, opening pathways for efficient and scalable active sensing for high-resolution egocentric vision. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/nblauch/fovi and https://huggingface.co/fovi-pytorch.]]></description>

Visually-guided acoustic highlighting seeks to rebalance audio in alignment with the accompanying video, creating a coherent audio-visual experience. While visual saliency and enhancement have been widely studied, acoustic highlighting remains underexplored, often leading to misalignment between visual and auditory focus. Existing approaches use discriminative models, which struggle with the inherent ambiguity in audio remixing, where no natural one-to-one mapping exists between poorly-balanced and well-balanced audio mixes. To address this limitation, we reframe this task as a generative problem and introduce a Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) framework. A key challenge in iterative flow-based generation is that early prediction errors -- in selecting the correct source to enhance -- compound over steps and push trajectories off-manifold. To address this, we introduce a rollout loss that penalizes drift at the final step, encouraging self-correcting trajectories and stabilizing long-range flow integration. We further propose a conditioning module that fuses audio and visual cues before vector field regression, enabling explicit cross-modal source selection. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our method consistently surpasses the previous state-of-the-art discriminative approach, establishing that visually-guided audio remixing is best addressed through generative modeling.]]></description>

Most vision models are trained on RGB images processed through ISP pipelines optimized for human perception, which can discard sensor-level information useful for machine reasoning. RAW images preserve unprocessed scene data, enabling models to leverage richer cues for both object detection and object description, capturing fine-grained details, spatial relationships, and contextual information often lost in processed images. To support research in this domain, we introduce RAWDet-7, a large-scale dataset of ~25k training and 7.6k test RAW images collected across diverse cameras, lighting conditions, and environments, densely annotated for seven object categories following MS-COCO and LVIS conventions. In addition, we provide object-level descriptions derived from the corresponding high-resolution sRGB images, facilitating the study of object-level information preservation under RAW image processing and low-bit quantization. The dataset allows evaluation under simulated 4-bit, 6-bit, and 8-bit quantization, reflecting realistic sensor constraints, and provides a benchmark for studying detection performance, description quality & detail, and generalization in low-bit RAW image processing.

While representation alignment with self-supervised models has been shown to improve diffusion model training, its potential for enhancing inference-time conditioning remains largely unexplored. We introduce Representation-Aligned Guidance (REPA-G), a framework that leverages these aligned representations, with rich semantic properties, to enable test-time conditioning from features in generation. By optimizing a similarity objective (the potential) at inference, we steer the denoising process toward a conditioned representation extracted from a pre-trained feature extractor. Our method provides versatile control at multiple scales, ranging from fine-grained texture matching via single patches to broad semantic guidance using global image feature tokens. We further extend this to multi-concept composition, allowing for the faithful combination of distinct concepts. REPA-G operates entirely at inference time, offering a flexible and precise alternative to often ambiguous text prompts or coarse class labels. We theoretically justify how this guidance enables sampling from the potential-induced tilted distribution. Quantitative results on ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that our approach achieves high-quality, diverse generations. Code is available at https://github.com/valeoai/REPA-G.]]></description>

Paleoradiology, the use of modern imaging technologies to study archaeological and anthropological remains, offers new windows on millennial scale patterns of human health. Unfortunately, the radiographs collected during field campaigns are heterogeneous: bones are disarticulated, positioning is ad hoc, and laterality markers are often absent. Additionally, factors such as age at death, age of bone, sex, and imaging equipment introduce high variability. Thus, content navigation, such as identifying a subset of images with a specific projection view, can be time consuming and difficult, making efficient triaging a bottleneck for expert analysis. We report a zero shot prompting strategy that leverages a state of the art Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) to automatically identify the main bone, projection view, and laterality in such images. Our pipeline converts raw DICOM files to bone windowed PNGs, submits them to the LVLM with a carefully engineered prompt, and receives structured JSON outputs, which are extracted and formatted onto a spreadsheet in preparation for validation. On a random sample of 100 images reviewed by an expert board certified paleoradiologist, the system achieved 92% main bone accuracy, 80% projection view accuracy, and 100% laterality accuracy, with low or medium confidence flags for ambiguous cases. These results suggest that LVLMs can substantially accelerate code word development for large paleoradiology datasets, allowing for efficient content navigation in future anthropology workflows.]]></description>

We introduce a framework that automates the transformation of static anime illustrations into manipulatable 2.5D models. Current professional workflows require tedious manual segmentation and the artistic ``hallucination'' of occluded regions to enable motion. Our approach overcomes this by decomposing a single image into fully inpainted, semantically distinct layers with inferred drawing orders. To address the scarcity of training data, we introduce a scalable engine that bootstraps high-quality supervision from commercial Live2D models, capturing pixel-perfect semantics and hidden geometry. Our methodology couples a diffusion-based Body Part Consistency Module, which enforces global geometric coherence, with a pixel-level pseudo-depth inference mechanism. This combination resolves the intricate stratification of anime characters, e.g., interleaving hair strands, allowing for dynamic layer reconstruction. We demonstrate that our approach yields high-fidelity, manipulatable models suitable for professional, real-time animation applications.]]></description>

Autoregressive video world models predict future visual observations conditioned on actions. While effective over short horizons, these models often struggle with long-horizon generation, as small prediction errors accumulate over time. Prior methods alleviate this by introducing pre-trained teacher models and sequence-level distribution matching, which incur additional computational cost and fail to prevent error propagation beyond the training horizon. In this work, we propose LIVE, a Long-horizon Interactive Video world modEl that enforces bounded error accumulation via a novel cycle-consistency objective, thereby eliminating the need for teacher-based distillation. Specifically, LIVE first performs a forward rollout from ground-truth frames and then applies a reverse generation process to reconstruct the initial state. The diffusion loss is subsequently computed on the reconstructed terminal state, providing an explicit constraint on long-horizon error propagation. Moreover, we provide an unified view that encompasses different approaches and introduce progressive training curriculum to stabilize training. Experiments demonstrate that LIVE achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon benchmarks, generating stable, high-quality videos far beyond training rollout lengths.]]></description>

Autonomous inspection of underground infrastructure, such as sewer and culvert systems, is critical to public safety and urban sustainability. Although robotic platforms equipped with visual sensors can efficiently detect structural deficiencies, the automated generation of human-readable summaries from these detections remains a significant challenge, especially on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper presents a novel two-stage pipeline for end-to-end summarization of underground deficiencies, combining our lightweight RAPID-SCAN segmentation model with a fine-tuned Vision-Language Model (VLM) deployed on an edge computing platform. The first stage employs RAPID-SCAN (Resource-Aware Pipeline Inspection and Defect Segmentation using Compact Adaptive Network), achieving 0.834 F1-score with only 0.64M parameters for efficient defect segmentation. The second stage utilizes a fine-tuned Phi-3.5 VLM that generates concise, domain-specific summaries in natural language from the segmentation outputs. We introduce a curated dataset of inspection images with manually verified descriptions for VLM fine-tuning and evaluation. To enable real-time performance, we employ post-training quantization with hardware-specific optimization, achieving significant reductions in model size and inference latency without compromising summarization quality. We deploy and evaluate our complete pipeline on a mobile robotic platform, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world inspection scenarios. Our results show the potential of edge-deployable integrated AI systems to bridge the gap between automated defect detection and actionable insights for infrastructure maintenance, paving the way for more scalable and autonomous inspection solutions.]]></description>

Monitoring bottom-hole variables in petroleum wells is essential for production optimization, safety, and emissions reduction. Permanent Downhole Gauges (PDGs) provide real-time pressure data but face reliability and cost issues. We propose a machine learning-based soft sensor to estimate flowing Bottom-Hole Pressure (BHP) using wellhead and topside measurements. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is introduced and compared with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Ridge Regression. We also pioneer Transfer Learning for adapting models across operational environments. Tested on real offshore datasets from Brazil's Pre-salt basin, the methodology achieved Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) consistently below 2\%, outperforming benchmarks. This work offers a cost-effective, accurate alternative to physical sensors, with broad applicability across diverse reservoir and flow conditions.]]></description>

Large vision-language models have achieved remarkable progress in visual reasoning, yet most existing systems rely on single-step or text-only reasoning, limiting their ability to iteratively refine understanding across multiple visual contexts. To address this limitation, we introduce a new multi-round visual reasoning benchmark with training and test sets spanning both detection and segmentation tasks, enabling systematic evaluation under iterative reasoning scenarios. We further propose RegionReasoner, a reinforcement learning framework that enforces grounded reasoning by requiring each reasoning trace to explicitly cite the corresponding reference bounding boxes, while maintaining semantic coherence via a global-local consistency reward. This reward extracts key objects and nouns from both global scene captions and region-level captions, aligning them with the reasoning trace to ensure consistency across reasoning steps. RegionReasoner is optimized with structured rewards combining grounding fidelity and global-local semantic alignment. Experiments on detection and segmentation tasks show that RegionReasoner-7B, together with our newly introduced benchmark RegionDial-Bench, considerably improves multi-round reasoning accuracy, spatial grounding precision, and global-local consistency, establishing a strong baseline for this emerging research direction.]]></description>

The Multiplicative Weights Exponential Mechanism (MWEM) is a fundamental iterative framework for private data analysis, with broad applications such as answering $m$ linear queries, or privately solving systems of $m$ linear constraints. However, a critical bottleneck hindering its scalability is the $Θ(m)$ time complexity required to execute the exponential mechanism in each iteration. We introduce a modification to the MWEM framework that improves the per-iteration runtime dependency to $Θ(\sqrt{m})$ in expectation. This is done via a lazy sampling approach to the Report-Noisy-Max mechanism, which we implement efficiently using Gumbel noise and a $k$-Nearest Neighbor data structure. This allows for the rapid selection of the approximate score in the exponential mechanism without an exhaustive linear scan. We apply our accelerated framework to the problems of private linear query release and solving Linear Programs (LPs) under neighboring constraint conditions and low-sensitivity assumptions. Experimental evaluation confirms that our method provides a substantial runtime improvement over classic MWEM.]]></description>

Organizations handling sensitive documents face a tension: cloud-based AI risks GDPR violations, while local systems typically require 18-32 GB RAM. This paper presents CUBO, a systems-oriented RAG platform for consumer laptops with 16 GB shared memory. CUBO's novelty lies in engineering integration of streaming ingestion (O(1) buffer overhead), tiered hybrid retrieval, and hardware-aware orchestration that enables competitive Recall@10 (0.48-0.97 across BEIR domains) within a hard 15.5 GB RAM ceiling. The 37,000-line codebase achieves retrieval latencies of 185 ms (p50) on C1,300 laptops while maintaining data minimization through local-only processing aligned with GDPR Art. 5(1)(c). Evaluation on BEIR benchmarks validates practical deployability for small-to-medium professional archives. The codebase is publicly available at https://github.com/PaoloAstrino/CUBO.]]></description>

Generative models trained using self-supervision of tokenized electronic health record (EHR) timelines show promise for clinical outcome prediction. This is typically done using Monte Carlo simulation for future patient trajectories. However, existing approaches suffer from three key limitations: sparse estimate distributions that poorly differentiate patient risk levels, extreme computational costs, and high sampling variance. We propose two new estimators: the Sum of Conditional Outcome Probability Estimator (SCOPE) and Risk Estimation from Anticipated Conditional Hazards (REACH), that leverage next-token probability distributions discarded by standard Monte Carlo. We prove both estimators are unbiased and that REACH guarantees variance reduction over Monte Carlo sampling for any model and outcome. Empirically, on hospital mortality prediction in MIMIC-IV using the ETHOS-ARES framework, SCOPE and REACH match 100-sample Monte Carlo performance using only 10-11 samples (95% CI: [9,11]), representing a ~10x reduction in inference cost without degrading calibration. For ICU admission prediction, efficiency gains are more modest (~1.2x), which we attribute to the outcome's lower "spontaneity," a property we characterize theoretically and empirically. These methods substantially improve the feasibility of deploying generative EHR models in resource-constrained clinical settings.]]></description>

Sampling from unnormalized probability densities is a central challenge in computational science. Boltzmann generators are generative models that enable independent sampling from the Boltzmann distribution of physical systems at a given temperature. However, their practical success depends on data-efficient training, as both simulation data and target energy evaluations are costly. To this end, we propose off-policy log-dispersion regularization (LDR), a novel regularization framework that builds on a generalization of the log-variance objective. We apply LDR in the off-policy setting in combination with standard data-based training objectives, without requiring additional on-policy samples. LDR acts as a shape regularizer of the energy landscape by leveraging additional information in the form of target energy labels. The proposed regularization framework is broadly applicable, supporting unbiased or biased simulation datasets as well as purely variational training without access to target samples. Across all benchmarks, LDR improves both final performance and data efficiency, with sample efficiency gains of up to one order of magnitude.]]></description>

Agentic reinforcement learning has enabled large language models to perform complex multi-turn planning and tool use. However, learning in long-horizon settings remains challenging due to sparse, trajectory-level outcome rewards. While prior tree-based methods attempt to mitigate this issue, they often suffer from high variance and computational inefficiency. Through empirical analysis of search agents, We identify a common pattern: performance diverges mainly due to decisions near the tail. Motivated by this observation, we propose Branching Relative Policy Optimization (BranPO), a value-free method that provides step-level contrastive supervision without dense rewards. BranPO truncates trajectories near the tail and resamples alternative continuations to construct contrastive suffixes over shared prefixes, reducing credit ambiguity in long-horizon rollouts. To further boost efficiency and stabilize training, we introduce difficulty-aware branch sampling to adapt branching frequency across tasks, and redundant step masking to suppress uninformative actions. Extensive experiments on various question answering benchmarks demonstrate that BranPO consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving significant accuracy gains on long-horizon tasks without increasing the overall training budget. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/YubaoZhao/BranPO}{code}.]]></description>

Federated learning in vehicular edge networks faces major challenges in efficient resource allocation, largely due to high vehicle mobility and the presence of imperfect channel state information. Many existing methods oversimplify these realities, often assuming fixed communication rounds or ideal channel conditions, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose variable rate vehicular federated learning (VR-VFL), a novel federated learning method designed specifically for vehicular networks under imperfect channel state information. VR-VFL combines dynamic client selection with adaptive transmission rate selection, while also allowing round times to flex in response to changing wireless conditions. At its core, VR-VFL is built on a bi-objective optimization framework that strikes a balance between improving learning convergence and minimizing the time required to complete each round. By accounting for both the challenges of mobility and realistic wireless constraints, VR-VFL offers a more practical and efficient approach to federated learning in vehicular edge networks. Simulation results show that the proposed VR-VFL scheme achieves convergence approximately 40% faster than other methods in the literature.]]></description>

Understanding culture requires reasoning across context, tradition, and implicit social knowledge, far beyond recalling isolated facts. Yet most culturally focused question answering (QA) benchmarks rely on single-hop questions, which may allow models to exploit shallow cues rather than demonstrate genuine cultural reasoning. In this work, we introduce ID-MoCQA, the first large-scale multi-hop QA dataset for assessing the cultural understanding of large language models (LLMs), grounded in Indonesian traditions and available in both English and Indonesian. We present a new framework that systematically transforms single-hop cultural questions into multi-hop reasoning chains spanning six clue types (e.g., commonsense, temporal, geographical). Our multi-stage validation pipeline, combining expert review and LLM-as-a-judge filtering, ensures high-quality question-answer pairs. Our evaluation across state-of-the-art models reveals substantial gaps in cultural reasoning, particularly in tasks requiring nuanced inference. ID-MoCQA provides a challenging and essential benchmark for advancing the cultural competency of LLMs.]]></description>

Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across many tasks but suffer from high inference latency due to autoregressive decoding. The issue is exacerbated in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which generate lengthy chains of thought. While speculative decoding accelerates inference by drafting and verifying multiple tokens in parallel, existing methods operate at the token level and ignore semantic equivalence (i.e., different token sequences expressing the same meaning), leading to inefficient rejections. We propose SemanticSpec, a semantic-aware speculative decoding framework that verifies entire semantic sequences instead of tokens. SemanticSpec introduces a semantic probability estimation mechanism that probes the model's internal hidden states to assess the likelihood of generating sequences with specific meanings.Experiments on four benchmarks show that SemanticSpec achieves up to 2.7x speedup on DeepSeekR1-32B and 2.1x on QwQ-32B, consistently outperforming token-level and sequence-level baselines in both efficiency and effectiveness.]]></description>

Long-horizon omnimodal question answering answers questions by reasoning over text, images, audio, and video. Despite recent progress on OmniLLMs, low-resource long audio-video QA still suffers from costly dense encoding, weak fine-grained retrieval, limited proactive planning, and no clear end-to-end optimization.To address these issues, we propose OmniRAG-Agent, an agentic omnimodal QA method for budgeted long audio-video reasoning. It builds an image-audio retrieval-augmented generation module that lets an OmniLLM fetch short, relevant frames and audio snippets from external banks. Moreover, it uses an agent loop that plans, calls tools across turns, and merges retrieved evidence to answer complex queries. Furthermore, we apply group relative policy optimization to jointly improve tool use and answer quality over time. Experiments on OmniVideoBench, WorldSense, and Daily-Omni show that OmniRAG-Agent consistently outperforms prior methods under low-resource settings and achieves strong results, with ablations validating each component.]]></description>

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made automated multiple-choice question (MCQ) generation increasingly feasible; however, reliably producing items that satisfy controlled cognitive demands remains a challenge. To address this gap, we introduce ReQUESTA, a hybrid, multi-agent framework for generating cognitively diverse MCQs that systematically target text-based, inferential, and main idea comprehension. ReQUESTA decomposes MCQ authoring into specialized subtasks and coordinates LLM-powered agents with rule-based components to support planning, controlled generation, iterative evaluation, and post-processing. We evaluated the framework in a large-scale reading comprehension study using academic expository texts, comparing ReQUESTA-generated MCQs with those produced by a single-pass GPT-5 zero-shot baseline. Psychometric analyses of learner responses assessed item difficulty and discrimination, while expert raters evaluated question quality across multiple dimensions, including topic relevance and distractor quality. Results showed that ReQUESTA-generated items were consistently more challenging, more discriminative, and more strongly aligned with overall reading comprehension performance. Expert evaluations further indicated stronger alignment with central concepts and superior distractor linguistic consistency and semantic plausibility, particularly for inferential questions. These findings demonstrate that hybrid, agentic orchestration can systematically improve the reliability and controllability of LLM-based generation, highlighting workflow design as a key lever for structured artifact generation beyond single-pass prompting.]]></description>

Large language models are increasingly trained in continual or open-ended settings, where the total training horizon is not known in advance. Despite this, most existing pretraining recipes are not anytime: they rely on horizon-dependent learning rate schedules and extensive tuning under a fixed compute budget. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating the existence of anytime learning schedules for overparameterized linear regression, and we highlight the central role of weight averaging - also known as model merging - in achieving the minimax convergence rates of stochastic gradient descent. We show that these anytime schedules polynomially decay with time, with the decay rate determined by the source and capacity conditions of the problem. Empirically, we evaluate 150M and 300M parameter language models trained at 1-32x Chinchilla scale, comparing constant learning rates with weight averaging and $1/\sqrt{t}$ schedules with weight averaging against a well-tuned cosine schedule. Across the full training range, the anytime schedules achieve comparable final loss to cosine decay. Taken together, our results suggest that weight averaging combined with simple, horizon-free step sizes offers a practical and effective anytime alternative to cosine learning rate schedules for large language model pretraining.]]></description>

We introduce Adaptive Spectral Shaping, a data-driven framework for graph filtering that learns a reusable baseline spectral kernel and modulates it with a small set of Gaussian factors. The resulting multi-peak, multi-scale responses allocate energy to heterogeneous regions of the Laplacian spectrum while remaining interpretable via explicit centers and bandwidths. To scale, we implement filters with Chebyshev polynomial expansions, avoiding eigendecompositions. We further propose Transferable Adaptive Spectral Shaping (TASS): the baseline kernel is learned on source graphs and, on a target graph, kept fixed while only the shaping parameters are adapted, enabling few-shot transfer under matched compute. Across controlled synthetic benchmarks spanning graph families and signal regimes, Adaptive Spectral Shaping reduces reconstruction error relative to fixed-prototype wavelets and learned linear banks, and TASS yields consistent positive transfer. The framework provides compact spectral modules that plug into graph signal processing pipelines and graph neural networks, combining scalability, interpretability, and cross-graph generalization.]]></description>

Large language models (LLMs) rely on internal knowledge to solve many downstream tasks, making it crucial to keep them up to date. Since full retraining is expensive, prior work has explored efficient alternatives such as model editing and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. However, these approaches often break down in practice due to poor generalization across inputs, limited stability, and knowledge conflict. To address these limitations, we propose the CoRSA (Conflict-Resolving and Sharpness-Aware Minimization) training framework, a parameter-efficient, holistic approach for knowledge editing with multiple updates. CoRSA tackles multiple challenges simultaneously: it improves generalization to different input forms and enhances stability across multiple updates by minimizing loss curvature, and resolves conflicts by maximizing the margin between new and prior knowledge. Across three widely used fact editing benchmarks, CoRSA achieves significant gains in generalization, outperforming baselines with average absolute improvements of 12.42% over LoRA and 10% over model editing methods. With multiple updates, it maintains high update efficacy while reducing catastrophic forgetting by 27.82% compared to LoRA. CoRSA also generalizes to the code domain, outperforming the strongest baseline by 5.48% Pass@5 in update efficacy.]]></description>

While existing multi-agent systems (MAS) can handle complex problems by enabling collaboration among multiple agents, they are often highly task-specific, relying on manually crafted agent roles and interaction prompts, which leads to increased architectural complexity and limited reusability across tasks. Moreover, most MAS communicate primarily through natural language, making them vulnerable to error accumulation and instability in long-context, multi-stage interactions within internal agent histories.
  In this work, we propose \textbf{Agent Primitives}, a set of reusable latent building blocks for LLM-based MAS. Inspired by neural network design, where complex models are built from reusable components, we observe that many existing MAS architectures can be decomposed into a small number of recurring internal computation patterns. Based on this observation, we instantiate three primitives: Review, Voting and Selection, and Planning and Execution. All primitives communicate internally via key-value (KV) cache, which improves both robustness and efficiency by mitigating information degradation across multi-stage interactions. To enable automatic system construction, an Organizer agent selects and composes primitives for each query, guided by a lightweight knowledge pool of previously successful configurations, forming a primitive-based MAS.
  Experiments show that primitives-based MAS improve average accuracy by 12.0-16.5\% over single-agent baselines, reduce token usage and inference latency by approximately 3$\times$-4$\times$ compared to text-based MAS, while incurring only 1.3$\times$-1.6$\times$ overhead relative to single-agent inference and providing more stable performance across model backbones.]]></description>

Document parsing is now widely used in applications, such as large-scale document digitization, retrieval-augmented generation, and domain-specific pipelines in healthcare and education. Benchmarking these models is crucial for assessing their reliability and practical robustness. Existing benchmarks mostly target high-resource languages and provide limited coverage for low-resource settings, such as Turkish. Moreover, existing studies on Turkish document parsing lack a standardized benchmark that reflects real-world scenarios and document diversity. To address this gap, we introduce OCRTurk, a Turkish document parsing benchmark covering multiple layout elements and document categories at three difficulty levels. OCRTurk consists of 180 Turkish documents drawn from academic articles, theses, slide decks, and non-academic articles. We evaluate seven OCR models on OCRTurk using element-wise metrics. Across difficulty levels, PaddleOCR achieves the strongest overall results, leading most element-wise metrics except figures and attaining high Normalized Edit Distance scores in easy, medium, and hard subsets. We also observe performance variation by document type. Models perform well on non-academic documents, while slideshows become the most challenging.]]></description>

We consider small-data, large-scale decision problems in which a firm must make many operational decisions simultaneously (e.g., across a large product portfolio) while observing only a few, potentially noisy, data points per instance. Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), we propose a pretrain-then-finetune approach built on a designed Transformer model to address this challenge. The model is first pretrained on large-scale, domain-informed synthetic data that encode managerial knowledge and structural features of the decision environment, and is then fine-tuned on real observations. This new pipeline offers two complementary advantages: pretraining injects domain knowledge into the learning process and enables the training of high-capacity models using abundant synthetic data, while finetuning adapts the pretrained model to the operational environment and improves alignment with the true data-generating regime. While we have leveraged the Transformer's state-of-the-art representational capacity, particularly its attention mechanism, to efficiently extract cross-task structure, our approach is not an off-the-shelf application. Instead, it relies on problem-specific architectural design and a tailored training procedure to match the decision setting. Theoretically, we develop the first comprehensive error analysis regarding Transformer learning in relevant contexts, establishing nonasymptotic guarantees that validate the method's effectiveness. Critically, our analysis reveals how pretraining and fine-tuning jointly determine performance, with the dominant contribution governed by whichever is more favorable. In particular, finetuning exhibits an economies-of-scale effect, whereby transfer learning becomes increasingly effective as the number of instances grows.]]></description>

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems remain brittle under realistic retrieval noise, even when the required evidence appears in the top-K results. A key reason is that retrievers and rerankers optimize solely for relevance, often selecting either trivial, answer-revealing passages or evidence that lacks the critical information required to answer the question, without considering whether the evidence is suitable for the generator. We propose BAR-RAG, which reframes the reranker as a boundary-aware evidence selector that targets the generator's Goldilocks Zone -- evidence that is neither trivially easy nor fundamentally unanswerable for the generator, but is challenging yet sufficient for inference and thus provides the strongest learning signal. BAR-RAG trains the selector with reinforcement learning using generator feedback, and adopts a two-stage pipeline that fine-tunes the generator under the induced evidence distribution to mitigate the distribution mismatch between training and inference. Experiments on knowledge-intensive question answering benchmarks show that BAR-RAG consistently improves end-to-end performance under noisy retrieval, achieving an average gain of 10.3 percent over strong RAG and reranking baselines while substantially improving robustness. Code is publicly avaliable at https://github.com/GasolSun36/BAR-RAG.]]></description>

Multi-round LLM-based multi-agent systems rely on effective communication structures to support collaboration across rounds. However, most existing methods employ a fixed communication topology during inference, which falls short in many realistic applications where the agents' roles may change \textit{across rounds} due to dynamic adversary, task progression, or time-varying constraints such as communication bandwidth. In this paper, we propose addressing this issue through TodyComm, a \textbf{t}ask-\textbf{o}riented \textbf{dy}namic \textbf{comm}unication algorithm. It produces behavior-driven collaboration topologies that adapt to the dynamics at each round, optimizing the utility for the task through policy gradient. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that under both dynamic adversary and communications budgets, TodyComm delivers superior task effectiveness while retaining token efficiency and scalability.]]></description>

Tabular machine learning systems are frequently trained on data affected by non-uniform corruption, including noisy measurements, missing entries, and feature-specific biases. In practice, these defects are often documented only through column-level reliability indicators rather than instance-wise quality annotations, limiting the applicability of many robustness and cleaning techniques. We present QuAIL, a quality-informed training mechanism that incorporates feature reliability priors directly into the learning process. QuAIL augments existing models with a learnable feature-modulation layer whose updates are selectively constrained by a quality-dependent proximal regularizer, thereby inducing controlled adaptation across features of varying trustworthiness. This stabilizes optimization under structured corruption without explicit data repair or sample-level reweighting. Empirical evaluation across 50 classification and regression datasets demonstrates that QuAIL consistently improves average performance over neural baselines under both random and value-dependent corruption, with especially robust behavior in low-data and systematically biased settings. These results suggest that incorporating feature reliability information directly into optimization dynamics is a practical and effective approach for resilient tabular learning.]]></description>

Training large language models (LLMs) is computationally expensive, partly because the loss exhibits slow power-law convergence whose origin remains debatable. Through systematic analysis of toy models and empirical evaluation of LLMs, we show that this behavior can arise intrinsically from the use of softmax and cross-entropy. When learning peaked probability distributions, e.g., next-token distributions, these components yield power-law vanishing losses and gradients, creating a fundamental optimization bottleneck. This ultimately leads to power-law time scaling of the loss with a universal exponent of $1/3$. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for observed neural scaling and suggest new directions for improving LLM training efficiency.]]></description>

We analyze the Accelerated Noisy Power Method, an algorithm for Principal Component Analysis in the setting where only inexact matrix-vector products are available, which can arise for instance in decentralized PCA. While previous works have established that acceleration can improve convergence rates compared to the standard Noisy Power Method, these guarantees require overly restrictive upper bounds on the magnitude of the perturbations, limiting their practical applicability. We provide an improved analysis of this algorithm, which preserves the accelerated convergence rate under much milder conditions on the perturbations. We show that our new analysis is worst-case optimal, in the sense that the convergence rate cannot be improved, and that the noise conditions we derive cannot be relaxed without sacrificing convergence guarantees. We demonstrate the practical relevance of our results by deriving an accelerated algorithm for decentralized PCA, which has similar communication costs to non-accelerated methods. To our knowledge, this is the first decentralized algorithm for PCA with provably accelerated convergence.]]></description>

The quadratic computational complexity of softmax transformers has become a bottleneck in long-context scenarios. In contrast, linear attention model families provide a promising direction towards a more efficient sequential model. These linear attention models compress past KV values into a single hidden state, thereby efficiently reducing complexity during both training and inference. However, their expressivity remains limited by the size of their hidden state. Previous work proposed interleaving softmax and linear attention layers to reduce computational complexity while preserving expressivity. Nevertheless, the efficiency of these models remains bottlenecked by their softmax attention layers. In this paper, we propose Neural Attention Search Linear (NAtS-L), a framework that applies both linear attention and softmax attention operations within the same layer on different tokens. NAtS-L automatically determines whether a token can be handled by a linear attention model, i.e., tokens that have only short-term impact and can be encoded into fixed-size hidden states, or require softmax attention, i.e., tokens that contain information related to long-term retrieval and need to be preserved for future queries. By searching for optimal Gated DeltaNet and softmax attention combinations across tokens, we show that NAtS-L provides a strong yet efficient token-level hybrid architecture.]]></description>

Log files record computational events that reflect system state and behavior, making them a primary source of operational insights in modern computer systems. Automated anomaly detection on logs is therefore critical, yet most established methods rely on log parsers that collapse messages into discrete templates, discarding variable values and semantic content. We propose ContraLog, a parser-free and self-supervised method that reframes log anomaly detection as predicting continuous message embeddings rather than discrete template IDs. ContraLog combines a message encoder that produces rich embeddings for individual log messages with a sequence encoder to model temporal dependencies within sequences. The model is trained with a combination of masked language modeling and contrastive learning to predict masked message embeddings based on the surrounding context. Experiments on the HDFS, BGL, and Thunderbird benchmark datasets empirically demonstrate effectiveness on complex datasets with diverse log messages. Additionally, we find that message embeddings generated by ContraLog carry meaningful information and are predictive of anomalies even without sequence context. These results highlight embedding-level prediction as an approach for log anomaly detection, with potential applicability to other event sequences.]]></description>

Modality following serves as the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to selectively utilize multimodal contexts based on user instructions. It is fundamental to ensuring safety and reliability in real-world deployments. However, the underlying mechanisms governing this decision-making process remain poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate its working mechanism through an information flow lens. Our findings reveal that instruction tokens function as structural anchors for modality arbitration: Shallow attention layers perform non-selective information transfer, routing multimodal cues to these anchors as a latent buffer; Modality competition is resolved within deep attention layers guided by the instruction intent, while MLP layers exhibit semantic inertia, acting as an adversarial force. Furthermore, we identify a sparse set of specialized attention heads that drive this arbitration. Causal interventions demonstrate that manipulating a mere $5\%$ of these critical heads can decrease the modality-following ratio by $60\%$ through blocking, or increase it by $60\%$ through targeted amplification of failed samples. Our work provides a substantial step toward model transparency and offers a principled framework for the orchestration of multimodal information in MLLMs.]]></description>

Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is vital for manufacturing, yet traditional methods face significant challenges: unsupervised approaches yield rough localizations requiring manual thresholds, while supervised methods overfit due to scarce, imbalanced data. Both suffer from the "One Anomaly Class, One Model" limitation. To address this, we propose Referring Industrial Anomaly Segmentation (RIAS), a paradigm leveraging language to guide detection. RIAS generates precise masks from text descriptions without manual thresholds and uses universal prompts to detect diverse anomalies with a single model. We introduce the MVTec-Ref dataset to support this, designed with diverse referring expressions and focusing on anomaly patterns, notably with 95% small anomalies. We also propose the Dual Query Token with Mask Group Transformer (DQFormer) benchmark, enhanced by Language-Gated Multi-Level Aggregation (LMA) to improve multi-scale segmentation. Unlike traditional methods using redundant queries, DQFormer employs only "Anomaly" and "Background" tokens for efficient visual-textual integration. Experiments demonstrate RIAS's effectiveness in advancing IAD toward open-set capabilities. Code: https://github.com/swagger-coder/RIAS-MVTec-Ref.]]></description>

Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a physics-inspired learning algorithm that uses stationary states of a dynamical system both for inference and learning. In its original formulation it is limited to conservative systems, $\textit{i.e.}$ to dynamics which derive from an energy function. Given their importance in applications, it is important to extend EP to nonconservative systems, $\textit{i.e.}$ systems with non-reciprocal interactions. Previous attempts to generalize EP to such systems failed to compute the exact gradient of the cost function. Here we propose a framework that extends EP to arbitrary nonconservative systems, including feedforward networks. We keep the key property of equilibrium propagation, namely the use of stationary states both for inference and learning. However, we modify the dynamics in the learning phase by a term proportional to the non-reciprocal part of the interaction so as to obtain the exact gradient of the cost function. This algorithm can also be derived using a variational formulation that generates the learning dynamics through an energy function defined over an augmented state space. Numerical experiments using the MNIST database show that this algorithm achieves better performance and learns faster than previous proposals.]]></description>

Lane detection is a crucial perception task for all levels of automated vehicles (AVs) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, particularly in mixed-traffic environments where AVs must interact with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and challenging traffic scenarios. Current methods lack versatility in delivering accurate, robust, and real-time compatible lane detection, especially vision-based methods often neglect critical regions of the image and their spatial-temporal (ST) salience, leading to poor performance in difficult circumstances such as serious occlusion and dazzle lighting. This study introduces a novel sequential neural network model with a spatial-temporal attention mechanism to focus on key features of lane lines and exploit salient ST correlations among continuous image frames. The proposed model, built on a standard encoder-decoder structure and common neural network backbones, is trained and evaluated on three large-scale open-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strength and robustness of the proposed model, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in various testing scenarios. Furthermore, with the ST attention mechanism, the developed sequential neural network models exhibit fewer parameters and reduced Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) compared to baseline sequential models, highlighting their computational efficiency. Relevant data, code, and models are released at https://doi.org/10.4121/4619cab6-ae4a-40d5-af77-582a77f3d821.]]></description>

Learning \emph{latent actions} from diverse human videos enables scaling robot learning beyond embodiment-specific robot datasets, and these latent actions have recently been used as pseudo-action labels for vision-language-action (VLA) model pretraining. To make VLA pretraining effective, latent actions should contain information about the underlying agent's actions despite the absence of ground-truth labels. We propose \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew\textbf{P}oint \textbf{L}atent \textbf{A}ction \textbf{M}odel (\textbf{MVP-LAM}), which learns discrete latent actions that are highly informative about ground-truth actions from time-synchronized multi-view videos. MVP-LAM trains latent actions with a \emph{cross-viewpoint reconstruction} objective, so that a latent action inferred from one view must explain the future in another view, reducing reliance on viewpoint-specific cues. On Bridge V2, MVP-LAM produces more action-centric latent actions, achieving higher mutual information with ground-truth actions and improved action prediction, including under out-of-distribution evaluation. Finally, pretraining VLAs with MVP-LAM latent actions improves downstream manipulation performance on the SIMPLER and LIBERO-Long benchmarks.]]></description>

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) continue to struggle to make morally salient judgments in multimodal and socially ambiguous contexts. Prior works typically rely on binary or pairwise supervision, which often fail to capture the continuous and pluralistic nature of human moral reasoning. We present MM-SCALE (Multimodal Moral Scale), a large-scale dataset for aligning VLMs with human moral preferences through 5-point scalar ratings and explicit modality grounding. Each image-scenario pair is annotated with moral acceptability scores and grounded reasoning labels by humans using an interface we tailored for data collection, enabling listwise preference optimization over ranked scenario sets. By moving from discrete to scalar supervision, our framework provides richer alignment signals and finer calibration of multimodal moral reasoning. Experiments show that VLMs fine-tuned on MM-SCALE achieve higher ranking fidelity and more stable safety calibration than those trained with binary signals.]]></description>

Large language models excel as few-shot learners when provided with appropriate demonstrations, yet this strength becomes problematic in multiturn agent scenarios, where LLMs erroneously mimic their own previous responses as few-shot examples. Through attention analysis, we identify conversational inertia, a phenomenon where models exhibit strong diagonal attention to previous responses, which is associated with imitation bias that constrains exploration. This reveals a tension when transforming few-shot LLMs into agents: longer context enriches environmental feedback for exploitation, yet also amplifies conversational inertia that undermines exploration. Our key insight is that for identical states, actions generated with longer contexts exhibit stronger inertia than those with shorter contexts, enabling construction of preference pairs without environment rewards. Based on this, we propose Context Preference Learning to calibrate model preferences to favor low-inertia responses over highinertia ones. We further provide context management strategies at inference time to balance exploration and exploitation. Experimental results across eight agentic environments and one deep research scenario validate that our framework reduces conversational inertia and achieves performance improvements.]]></description>

How do neural networks trained over sequences acquire the ability to perform structured operations, such as arithmetic, geometric, and algorithmic computation? To gain insight into this question, we introduce the sequential group composition task. In this task, networks receive a sequence of elements from a finite group encoded in a real vector space and must predict their cumulative product. The task can be order-sensitive and requires a nonlinear architecture to be learned. Our analysis isolates the roles of the group structure, encoding statistics, and sequence length in shaping learning. We prove that two-layer networks learn this task one irreducible representation of the group at a time in an order determined by the Fourier statistics of the encoding. These networks can perfectly learn the task, but doing so requires a hidden width exponential in the sequence length $k$. In contrast, we show how deeper models exploit the associativity of the task to dramatically improve this scaling: recurrent neural networks compose elements sequentially in $k$ steps, while multilayer networks compose adjacent pairs in parallel in $\log k$ layers. Overall, the sequential group composition task offers a tractable window into the mechanics of deep learning.]]></description>

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLM factuality, yet design guidance remains English-centric, limiting insights for morphologically rich languages like Turkish. We address this by constructing a comprehensive Turkish RAG dataset derived from Turkish Wikipedia and CulturaX, comprising question-answer pairs and relevant passage chunks. We benchmark seven stages of the RAG pipeline, from query transformation and reranking to answer refinement, without task-specific fine-tuning. Our results show that complex methods like HyDE maximize accuracy (85%) that is considerably higher than the baseline (78.70%). Also a Pareto-optimal configuration using Cross-encoder Reranking and Context Augmentation achieves comparable performance (84.60%) with much lower cost. We further demonstrate that over-stacking generative modules can degrade performance by distorting morphological cues, whereas simple query clarification with robust reranking offers an effective solution.]]></description>

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to produce evidence-based responses, and its performance hinges on the matching between the retriever and LLMs. Retriever optimization has emerged as an efficient alternative to fine-tuning LLMs. However, existing solutions suffer from objective mismatch between retriever optimization and the goal of RAG pipeline. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising solution to address this limitation, yet applying RL to retriever optimization introduces two fundamental challenges: 1) the deterministic retrieval is incompatible with RL formulations, and 2) state aliasing arises from query-only retrieval in multi-hop reasoning. To address these challenges, we replace deterministic retrieval with stochastic sampling and formulate RAG as a Markov decision process, making retriever optimizable by RL. Further, we incorporate retrieval history into the state at each retrieval step to mitigate state aliasing. Extensive experiments across diverse RAG pipelines, datasets, and retriever scales demonstrate consistent improvements of our approach in RAG performance.]]></description>

Generating synthetic tabular data under severe class imbalance is essential for domains where rare but high-impact events drive decision-making. However, most generative models either overlook minority groups or fail to produce samples that are useful for downstream learning. We introduce CTTVAE, a Conditional Transformer-based Tabular Variational Autoencoder equipped with two complementary mechanisms: (i) a class-aware triplet margin loss that restructures the latent space for sharper intra-class compactness and inter-class separation, and (ii) a training-by-sampling strategy that adaptively increases exposure to underrepresented groups. Together, these components form CTTVAE+TBS, a framework that consistently yields more representative and utility-aligned samples without destabilizing training. Across six real-world benchmarks, CTTVAE+TBS achieves the strongest downstream utility on minority classes, often surpassing models trained on the original imbalanced data while maintaining competitive fidelity and bridging the gap for privacy for interpolation-based sampling methods and deep generative methods. Ablation studies further confirm that both latent structuring and targeted sampling contribute to these gains. By explicitly prioritizing downstream performance in rare categories, CTTVAE+TBS provides a robust and interpretable solution for conditional tabular data generation, with direct applicability to industries such as healthcare, fraud detection, and predictive maintenance where even small gains in minority cases can be critical.]]></description>

Information retrieval has long focused on ranking documents by semantic relatedness. Yet many real-world information needs demand more: enforcement of logical constraints, multi-step inference, and synthesis of multiple pieces of evidence. Addressing these requirements is, at its core, a problem of reasoning. Across AI communities, researchers are developing diverse solutions for the problem of reasoning, from inference-time strategies and post-training of LLMs, to neuro-symbolic systems, Bayesian and probabilistic frameworks, geometric representations, and energy-based models. These efforts target the same problem: to move beyond pattern-matching systems toward structured, verifiable inference. However, they remain scattered across disciplines, making it difficult for IR researchers to identify the most relevant ideas and opportunities. To help navigate the fragmented landscape of research in reasoning, this tutorial first articulates a working definition of reasoning within the context of information retrieval and derives from it a unified analytical framework. The framework maps existing approaches along axes that reflect the core components of the definition. By providing a comprehensive overview of recent approaches and mapping current methods onto the defined axes, we expose their trade-offs and complementarities, highlight where IR can benefit from cross-disciplinary advances, and illustrate how retrieval process itself can play a central role in broader reasoning systems. The tutorial will equip participants with both a conceptual framework and practical guidance for enhancing reasoning-capable IR systems, while situating IR as a domain that both benefits and contributes to the broader development of reasoning methodologies.]]></description>

Entropy regularization is a standard technique in reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance exploration, yet it yields negligible effects or even degrades performance in Large Language Models (LLMs). We attribute this failure to the cumulative tail risk inherent to LLMs with massive vocabularies and long generation horizons. In such environments, standard global entropy maximization indiscriminately dilutes probability mass into the vast tail of invalid tokens rather than focusing on plausible candidates, thereby disrupting coherent reasoning. To address this, we propose Trust Region Entropy (TRE), a method that encourages exploration strictly within the model's trust region. Extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning (MATH), combinatorial search (Countdown), and preference alignment (HH) tasks demonstrate that TRE consistently outperforms vanilla PPO, standard entropy regularization, and other exploration baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/WhyChaos/TRE-Encouraging-Exploration-in-the-Trust-Region.]]></description>

A consistent trend throughout the research of oriented object detection has been the pursuit of maintaining comparable performance with fewer and weaker annotations. This is particularly crucial in the remote sensing domain, where the dense object distribution and a wide variety of categories contribute to prohibitively high costs. Based on the supervision level, existing oriented object detection algorithms can be broadly grouped into fully supervised, semi-supervised, and weakly supervised methods. Within the scope of this work, we further categorize them to include sparsely supervised and partially weakly-supervised methods. To address the challenges of large-scale labeling, we introduce the first Sparse Partial Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection framework, designed to efficiently leverage only a few sparse weakly-labeled data and plenty of unlabeled data. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) We design a Sparse-annotation-Orientation-and-Scale-aware Student (SOS-Student) model to separate unlabeled objects from the background in a sparsely-labeled setting, and learn orientation and scale information from orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic weak annotations. (2) We construct a novel Multi-level Pseudo-label Filtering strategy that leverages the distribution of model predictions, which is informed by the model's multi-layer predictions. (3) We propose a unique sparse partitioning approach, ensuring equal treatment for each category. Extensive experiments on the DOTA and DIOR datasets show that our framework achieves a significant performance gain over traditional oriented object detection methods mentioned above, offering a highly cost-effective solution. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/VisionXLab/SPWOOD.]]></description>

Text-to-SQL systems have achieved strong performance on English benchmarks, yet their behavior in morphologically rich, low-resource languages remains largely unexplored. We introduce BIRDTurk, the first Turkish adaptation of the BIRD benchmark, constructed through a controlled translation pipeline that adapts schema identifiers to Turkish while strictly preserving the logical structure and execution semantics of SQL queries and databases. Translation quality is validated on a sample size determined by the Central Limit Theorem to ensure 95% confidence, achieving 98.15% accuracy on human-evaluated samples. Using BIRDTurk, we evaluate inference-based prompting, agentic multi-stage reasoning, and supervised fine-tuning. Our results reveal that Turkish introduces consistent performance degradation, driven by both structural linguistic divergence and underrepresentation in LLM pretraining, while agentic reasoning demonstrates stronger cross-lingual robustness. Supervised fine-tuning remains challenging for standard multilingual baselines but scales effectively with modern instruction-tuned models. BIRDTurk provides a controlled testbed for cross-lingual Text-to-SQL evaluation under realistic database conditions. We release the training and development splits to support future research.]]></description>

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in code generation and general reasoning, yet their capacity for autonomous multi-stage planning in high-dimensional, physically constrained environments remains an open research question. This study investigates the limits of current AI agents by evaluating them against the 12th Global Trajectory Optimization Competition (GTOC 12), a complex astrodynamics challenge requiring the design of a large-scale asteroid mining campaign. We adapt the MLE-Bench framework to the domain of orbital mechanics and deploy an AIDE-based agent architecture to autonomously generate and refine mission solutions. To assess performance beyond binary validity, we employ an "LLM-as-a-Judge" methodology, utilizing a rubric developed by domain experts to evaluate strategic viability across five structural categories. A comparative analysis of models, ranging from GPT-4-Turbo to reasoning-enhanced architectures like Gemini 2.5 Pro, and o3, reveals a significant trend: the average strategic viability score has nearly doubled in the last two years (rising from 9.3 to 17.2 out of 26). However, we identify a critical capability gap between strategy and execution. While advanced models demonstrate sophisticated conceptual understanding, correctly framing objective functions and mission architectures, they consistently fail at implementation due to physical unit inconsistencies, boundary condition errors, and inefficient debugging loops. We conclude that, while current LLMs often demonstrate sufficient knowledge and intelligence to tackle space science tasks, they remain limited by an implementation barrier, functioning as powerful domain facilitators rather than fully autonomous engineers.]]></description>

Diffusion-based models have demonstrated impressive accuracy and generalization in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, they still face significant limitations, such as high sampling costs and insufficient physical consistency, stemming from their many-step iterative sampling mechanism and lack of explicit physics constraints. To address these issues, we propose Phys-Instruct, a novel physics-guided distillation framework which not only (1) compresses a pre-trained diffusion PDE solver into a few-step generator via matching generator and prior diffusion distributions to enable rapid sampling, but also (2) enhances the physics consistency by explicitly injecting PDE knowledge through a PDE distillation guidance. Physic-Instruct is built upon a solid theoretical foundation, leading to a practical physics-constrained training objective that admits tractable gradients. Across five PDE benchmarks, Phys-Instruct achieves orders-of-magnitude faster inference while reducing PDE error by more than 8 times compared to state-of-the-art diffusion baselines. Moreover, the resulting unconditional student model functions as a compact prior, enabling efficient and physically consistent inference for various downstream conditional tasks. Our results indicate that Phys-Instruct is a novel, effective, and efficient framework for ultra-fast PDE solving powered by deep generative models.]]></description>

Semantic segmentation networks require large amounts of pixel-level annotated data, which are costly to obtain for real-world images. Computer graphics engines can generate synthetic images alongside their ground-truth annotations. However, models trained on such images can perform poorly on real images due to the domain gap between real and synthetic images. Style transfer methods can reduce this difference by applying a realistic style to synthetic images. Choosing effective data transformations and their sequence is difficult due to the large combinatorial search space of style transfer operators. Using multi-objective genetic algorithms, we optimize pipelines to balance structural coherence and style similarity to target domains. We study the use of paired-image metrics on individual image samples during evolution to enable rapid pipeline evaluation, as opposed to standard distributional metrics that require the generation of many images. After optimization, we evaluate the resulting Pareto front using distributional metrics and segmentation performance. We apply this approach to standard datasets in synthetic-to-real domain adaptation: from the video game GTA5 to real image datasets Cityscapes and ACDC, focusing on adverse conditions. Results demonstrate that evolutionary algorithms can propose diverse augmentation pipelines adapted to different objectives. The contribution of this work is the formulation of style transfer as a sequencing problem suitable for evolutionary optimization and the study of efficient metrics that enable feasible search in this space.

Retinal diseases spanning a broad spectrum can be effectively identified and diagnosed using complementary signals from multimodal data. However, multimodal diagnosis in ophthalmic practice is typically challenged in terms of data heterogeneity, potential invasiveness, registration complexity, and so on. As such, a unified framework that integrates multimodal data synthesis and fusion is proposed for retinal disease classification and grading. Specifically, the synthesized multimodal data incorporates fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), multispectral imaging (MSI), and saliency maps that emphasize latent lesions as well as optic disc/cup regions. Parallel models are independently trained to learn modality-specific representations that capture cross-pathophysiological signatures. These features are then adaptively calibrated within and across modalities to perform information pruning and flexible integration according to downstream tasks. The proposed learning system is thoroughly interpreted through visualizations in both image and feature spaces. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrated the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art ones in the tasks of multi-label classification (F1-score: 0.683, AUC: 0.953) and diabetic retinopathy grading (Accuracy:0.842, Kappa: 0.861). This work not only enhances the accuracy and efficiency of retinal disease screening but also offers a scalable framework for data augmentation across various medical imaging modalities.]]></description>

Training-free video understanding leverages the strong image comprehension capabilities of pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) by treating a video as a sequence of static frames, thus obviating the need for costly video-specific training. However, this paradigm often suffers from severe visual redundancy and high computational overhead, especially when processing long videos. Crucially, existing keyframe selection strategies, especially those based on CLIP similarity, are prone to biases and may inadvertently overlook critical frames, resulting in suboptimal video comprehension. To address these significant challenges, we propose \textbf{KTV}, a novel two-stage framework for efficient and effective training-free video understanding. In the first stage, KTV performs question-agnostic keyframe selection by clustering frame-level visual features, yielding a compact, diverse, and representative subset of frames that mitigates temporal redundancy. In the second stage, KTV applies key visual token selection, pruning redundant or less informative tokens from each selected keyframe based on token importance and redundancy, which significantly reduces the number of tokens fed into the LLM. Extensive experiments on the Multiple-Choice VideoQA task demonstrate that KTV outperforms state-of-the-art training-free baselines while using significantly fewer visual tokens, \emph{e.g.}, only 504 visual tokens for a 60-min video with 10800 frames, achieving $44.8\%$ accuracy on the MLVU-Test benchmark. In particular, KTV also exceeds several training-based approaches on certain benchmarks.]]></description>

Deep Neural Networks reached state-of-the-art performance across numerous domains, but this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large and over-parameterized models, posing serious challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. As a result, model compression has become essential, and -- among compression techniques -- weight quantization is largely used and particularly effective, yet it typically introduces a non-negligible accuracy drop. However, it is usually applied to already trained models, without influencing how the parameter space is explored during the learning phase. In contrast, we introduce per-layer regularization terms that drive weights to naturally form clusters during training, integrating quantization awareness directly into the optimization process. This reduces the accuracy loss typically associated with quantization methods while preserving their compression potential. Furthermore, in our framework quantization representatives become network parameters, marking, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to embed quantization parameters directly into the backpropagation procedure. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with AlexNet and VGG16 models confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.]]></description>

We analyze a lightweight simulation-based inference method that infers simulator parameters using only a regression-based projection of the observed data. After fitting a surrogate linear regression once, the procedure simulates small batches at the proposed parameter values and assigns kernel weights based on the resulting batch-residual discrepancy, producing a self-normalized pseudo-posterior that is simple, parallelizable, and requires access only to the fitted regression coefficients rather than raw observations. We formalize the construction as an importance-sampling approximation to a population target that averages over simulator randomness, prove consistency as the number of parameter draws grows, and establish stability in estimating the surrogate regression from finite samples. We then characterize the asymptotic concentration as the batch size increases and the bandwidth shrinks, showing that the pseudo-posterior concentrates on an identified set determined by the chosen projection, thereby clarifying when the method yields point versus set identification. Experiments on a tractable nonlinear model and on a cosmological calibration task using the DREAMS simulation suite illustrate the computational advantages of regression-based projections and the identifiability limitations arising from low-information summaries.]]></description>

Graph generative modelling has become an essential task due to the wide range of applications in chemistry, biology, social networks, and knowledge representation. In this work, we propose a novel framework for generating graphs by adapting the Generator Matching (arXiv:2410.20587) paradigm to graph-structured data. We leverage the graph Laplacian and its associated heat kernel to define a continous-time diffusion on each graph. The Laplacian serves as the infinitesimal generator of this diffusion, and its heat kernel provides a family of conditional perturbations of the initial graph. A neural network is trained to match this generator by minimising a Bregman divergence between the true generator and a learnable surrogate. Once trained, the surrogate generator is used to simulate a time-reversed diffusion process to sample new graph structures. Our framework unifies and generalises existing diffusion-based graph generative models, injecting domain-specific inductive bias via the Laplacian, while retaining the flexibility of neural approximators. Experimental studies demonstrate that our approach captures structural properties of real and synthetic graphs effectively.]]></description>

Counterfactual explanations (CFs) are increasingly integrated into Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) systems to improve transparency; however, ML models deployed via APIs are already vulnerable to privacy attacks such as membership inference and model extraction, and the impact of explanations on this threat landscape remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we focus on the problem of how CFs expand the attack surface of MLaaS by strengthening membership inference attacks (MIAs), and on the need to design defense mechanisms that mitigate this emerging risk without undermining utility and explainability. First, we systematically analyze how exposing CFs through query-based APIs enables more effective shadow-based MIAs. Second, we propose a defense framework that integrates Differential Privacy (DP) with Active Learning (AL) to jointly reduce memorization and limit effective training data exposure. Finally, we conduct an extensive empirical evaluation to characterize the three-way trade-off between privacy leakage, predictive performance, and explanation quality. Our findings highlight the need to carefully balance transparency, utility, and privacy in the responsible deployment of explainable MLaaS systems.]]></description>

The way customers search for and choose products is changing with the rise of large language models (LLMs). LLM-based search, or generative engines, provides direct product recommendations to users, rather than traditional online search results that require users to explore options themselves. However, these recommendations are strongly influenced by the initial retrieval order of LLMs, which disadvantages small businesses and independent creators by limiting their visibility.
  In this work, we propose CORE, an optimization method that \textbf{C}ontrols \textbf{O}utput \textbf{R}ankings in g\textbf{E}nerative Engines for LLM-based search. Since the LLM's interactions with the search engine are black-box, CORE targets the content returned by search engines as the primary means of influencing output rankings. Specifically, CORE optimizes retrieved content by appending strategically designed optimization content to steer the ranking of outputs. We introduce three types of optimization content: string-based, reasoning-based, and review-based, demonstrating their effectiveness in shaping output rankings. To evaluate CORE in realistic settings, we introduce ProductBench, a large-scale benchmark with 15 product categories and 200 products per category, where each product is associated with its top-10 recommendations collected from Amazon's search interface.
  Extensive experiments on four LLMs with search capabilities (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5, Claude-4, and Grok-3) demonstrate that CORE achieves an average Promotion Success Rate of \textbf{91.4\% @Top-5}, \textbf{86.6\% @Top-3}, and \textbf{80.3\% @Top-1}, across 15 product categories, outperforming existing ranking manipulation methods while preserving the fluency of optimized content.]]></description>

We present EB-JEPA, an open-source library for learning representations and world models using Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs). JEPAs learn to predict in representation space rather than pixel space, avoiding the pitfalls of generative modeling while capturing semantically meaningful features suitable for downstream tasks. Our library provides modular, self-contained implementations that illustrate how representation learning techniques developed for image-level self-supervised learning can transfer to video, where temporal dynamics add complexity, and ultimately to action-conditioned world models, where the model must additionally learn to predict the effects of control inputs. Each example is designed for single-GPU training within a few hours, making energy-based self-supervised learning accessible for research and education. We provide ablations of JEA components on CIFAR-10. Probing these representations yields 91% accuracy, indicating that the model learns useful features. Extending to video, we include a multi-step prediction example on Moving MNIST that demonstrates how the same principles scale to temporal modeling. Finally, we show how these representations can drive action-conditioned world models, achieving a 97% planning success rate on the Two Rooms navigation task. Comprehensive ablations reveal the critical importance of each regularization component for preventing representation collapse.

Machine learning-based anomaly detection systems are increasingly being adopted in 5G Core networks to monitor complex, high-volume traffic. However, most existing approaches are evaluated under strong assumptions that rarely hold in operational environments, notably the availability of independent and identically distributed (IID) data and the absence of adaptive attackers.In this work, we study the problem of detecting 5G attacks \textit{in the wild}, focusing on realistic deployment settings. We propose a set of Security-Aware Guidelines for Evaluating anomaly detectors in 5G Core Network (SAGE-5GC), driven by domain knowledge and consideration of potential adversarial threats. Using a realistic 5G Core dataset, we first train several anomaly detectors and assess their baseline performance against standard 5GC control-plane cyberattacks targeting PFCP-based network services.We then extend the evaluation to adversarial settings, where an attacker tries to manipulate the observable features of the network traffic to evade detection, under the constraint that the intended functionality of the malicious traffic is preserved. Starting from a selected set of controllable features, we analyze model sensitivity and adversarial robustness through randomized perturbations. Finally, we introduce a practical optimization strategy based on genetic algorithms that operates exclusively on attacker-controllable features and does not require prior knowledge of the underlying detection model. Our experimental results show that adversarially crafted attacks can substantially degrade detection performance, underscoring the need for robust, security-aware evaluation methodologies for anomaly detection in 5G networks deployed in the wild.]]></description>

Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos based on textual queries. Current methods mainly rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, this paradigm suffers from heavy data dependence and limited scalability against the rapid evolution of MLLMs. Although recent zero-shot approaches offer a flexible alternative, their performance remains significantly behind SFT-based methods, due to the straightforward workflow designs. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Refer-Agent}, a collaborative multi-agent system with alternating reasoning-reflection mechanisms. This system decomposes RVOS into step-by-step reasoning process. During reasoning, we introduce a Coarse-to-Fine frame selection strategy to ensure the frame diversity and textual relevance, along with a Dynamic Focus Layout that adaptively adjusts the agent's visual focus. Furthermore, we propose a Chain-of-Reflection mechanism, which employs a Questioner-Responder pair to generate a self-reflection chain, enabling the system to verify intermediate results and generates feedback for next-round reasoning refinement. Extensive experiments on five challenging benchmarks demonstrate that Refer-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including both SFT-based models and zero-shot approaches. Moreover, Refer-Agent is flexible and enables fast integration of new MLLMs without any additional fine-tuning costs. Code will be released.]]></description>

Anomaly detection identifies departures from expected behavior in safety-critical settings. When target-domain normal data are unavailable, zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) leverages vision-language models (VLMs). However, CLIP's coarse image-text alignment limits both localization and detection due to (i) spatial misalignment and (ii) weak sensitivity to fine-grained anomalies; prior work compensates with complex auxiliary modules yet largely overlooks the choice of backbone. We revisit the backbone and use TIPS-a VLM trained with spatially aware objectives. While TIPS alleviates CLIP's issues, it exposes a distributional gap between global and local features. We address this with decoupled prompts-fixed for image-level detection and learnable for pixel-level localization-and by injecting local evidence into the global score. Without CLIP-specific tricks, our TIPS-based pipeline improves image-level performance by 1.1-3.9% and pixel-level by 1.5-6.9% across seven industrial datasets, delivering strong generalization with a lean architecture.

Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) is a challenging task due to the extreme visual similarity between targets and backgrounds across varying marine depths. Existing methods often struggle with topological fragmentation of slender creatures in the deep sea and the subtle feature extraction of transparent organisms. In this paper, we propose DeepTopo-Net, a novel framework that integrates topology-aware modeling with frequency-decoupled perception. To address physical degradation, we design the Water-Conditioned Adaptive Perceptor (WCAP), which employs Riemannian metric tensors to dynamically deform convolutional sampling fields. Furthermore, the Abyssal-Topology Refinement Module (ATRM) is developed to maintain the structural connectivity of spindly targets through skeletal priors. Specifically, we first introduce GBU-UCOD, the first high-resolution (2K) benchmark tailored for marine vertical zonation, filling the data gap for hadal and abyssal zones. Extensive experiments on MAS3K, RMAS, and our proposed GBU-UCOD datasets demonstrate that DeepTopo-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in preserving the morphological integrity of complex underwater patterns. The datasets and codes will be released at https://github.com/Wuwenji18/GBU-UCOD.]]></description>

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in text understanding, which has paved the way for their expansion into video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to analyze video data. However, current Vid-LLMs struggle to simultaneously retain high-quality frame-level semantic information (i.e., a sufficient number of tokens per frame) and comprehensive video-level temporal information (i.e., an adequate number of sampled frames per video). This limitation hinders the advancement of Vid-LLMs towards fine-grained video understanding. To address this issue, we introduce the SlowFocus mechanism, which significantly enhances the equivalent sampling frequency without compromising the quality of frame-level visual tokens. SlowFocus begins by identifying the query-related temporal segment based on the posed question, then performs dense sampling on this segment to extract local high-frequency features. A multi-frequency mixing attention module is further leveraged to aggregate these local high-frequency details with global low-frequency contexts for enhanced temporal comprehension. Additionally, to tailor Vid-LLMs to this innovative mechanism, we introduce a set of training strategies aimed at bolstering both temporal grounding and detailed temporal reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we establish FineAction-CGR, a benchmark specifically devised to assess the ability of Vid-LLMs to process fine-grained temporal understanding tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our mechanism across both existing public video understanding benchmarks and our proposed FineAction-CGR.]]></description>

In this work, we focus on the Partial Constraint Satisfaction Problem (PCSP) over control-flow graphs (CFGs) of programs. PCSP serves as a generalization of the well-known Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). In the CSP framework, we define a set of variables, a set of constraints, and a finite domain $D$ that encompasses all possible values for each variable. The objective is to assign a value to each variable in such a way that all constraints are satisfied. In the graph variant of CSP, an underlying graph is considered and we have one variable corresponding to each vertex of the graph and one or several constraints corresponding to each edge. In PCSPs, we allow for certain constraints to be violated at a specified cost, aiming to find a solution that minimizes the total cost. Numerous classical compiler optimization tasks can be framed as PCSPs over control-flow graphs. Examples include Register Allocation, Lifetime-optimal Speculative Partial Redundancy Elimination (LOSPRE), and Optimal Placement of Bank Selection Instructions. On the other hand, it is well-known that control-flow graphs of structured programs are sparse and decomposable in a variety of ways. In this work, we rely on the Series-Parallel-Loop (SPL) decompositions as introduced by~\cite{RegisterAllocation}. Our main contribution is a general algorithm for PCSPs over SPL graphs with a time complexity of \(O(|G| \cdot |D|^6)\), where \(|G|\) represents the size of the control-flow graph. Note that for any fixed domain $D,$ this yields a linear-time solution. Our algorithm can be seen as a generalization and unification of previous SPL-based approaches for register allocation and LOSPRE. In addition, we provide experimental results over another classical PCSP task, i.e. Optimal Bank Selection, achieving runtimes four times better than the previous state of the art.]]></description>

Current language models (LMs) excel at reasoning over prompts using pre-trained knowledge. However, real-world tasks are far more complex and context-dependent: models must learn from task-specific context and leverage new knowledge beyond what is learned during pre-training to reason and resolve tasks. We term this capability context learning, a crucial ability that humans naturally possess but has been largely overlooked. To this end, we introduce CL-bench, a real-world benchmark consisting of 500 complex contexts, 1,899 tasks, and 31,607 verification rubrics, all crafted by experienced domain experts. Each task is designed such that the new content required to resolve it is contained within the corresponding context. Resolving tasks in CL-bench requires models to learn from the context, ranging from new domain-specific knowledge, rule systems, and complex procedures to laws derived from empirical data, all of which are absent from pre-training. This goes far beyond long-context tasks that primarily test retrieval or reading comprehension, and in-context learning tasks, where models learn simple task patterns via instructions and demonstrations. Our evaluations of ten frontier LMs find that models solve only 17.2% of tasks on average. Even the best-performing model, GPT-5.1, solves only 23.7%, revealing that LMs have yet to achieve effective context learning, which poses a critical bottleneck for tackling real-world, complex context-dependent tasks. CL-bench represents a step towards building LMs with this fundamental capability, making them more intelligent and advancing their deployment in real-world scenarios.]]></description>

Prior work on probing neural networks primarily relies on input-space analysis or parameter perturbation, both of which face fundamental limitations in accessing structural information encoded in intermediate representations. We introduce Activation Perturbation for EXploration (APEX), an inference-time probing paradigm that perturbs hidden activations while keeping both inputs and model parameters fixed. We theoretically show that activation perturbation induces a principled transition from sample-dependent to model-dependent behavior by suppressing input-specific signals and amplifying representation-level structure, and further establish that input perturbation corresponds to a constrained special case of this framework. Through representative case studies, we demonstrate the practical advantages of APEX. In the small-noise regime, APEX provides a lightweight and efficient measure of sample regularity that aligns with established metrics, while also distinguishing structured from randomly labeled models and revealing semantically coherent prediction transitions. In the large-noise regime, APEX exposes training-induced model-level biases, including a pronounced concentration of predictions on the target class in backdoored models. Overall, our results show that APEX offers an effective perspective for exploring, and understanding neural networks beyond what is accessible from input space alone.]]></description>

Policy gradient methods rely on a baseline to measure the relative advantage of an action, ensuring the model reinforces behaviors that outperform its current average capability. In the training of Large Language Models (LLMs) using Actor-Critic methods (e.g., PPO), this baseline is typically estimated by a Value Model (Critic) often as large as the policy model itself. However, as the policy continuously evolves, the value model requires expensive, synchronous incremental training to accurately track the shifting capabilities of the policy. To avoid this overhead, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) eliminates the coupled value model by using the average reward of a group of rollouts as the baseline; yet, this approach necessitates extensive sampling to maintain estimation stability. In this paper, we propose $V_0$, a Generalist Value Model capable of estimating the expected performance of any model on unseen prompts without requiring parameter updates. We reframe value estimation by treating the policy's dynamic capability as an explicit context input; specifically, we leverage a history of instruction-performance pairs to dynamically profile the model, departing from the traditional paradigm that relies on parameter fitting to perceive capability shifts. Focusing on value estimation at State Zero (i.e., the initial prompt, hence $V_0$), our model serves as a critical resource scheduler. During GRPO training, $V_0$ predicts success rates prior to rollout, allowing for efficient sampling budget allocation; during deployment, it functions as a router, dispatching instructions to the most cost-effective and suitable model. Empirical results demonstrate that $V_0$ significantly outperforms heuristic budget allocation and achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off between performance and cost in LLM routing tasks.]]></description>

Inverse design with physics-based objectives is challenging because it couples high-dimensional geometry with expensive simulations, as exemplified by aerodynamic shape optimization for drag reduction. We revisit inverse design through two canonical solutions, the optimal design point and the optimal design distribution, and relate them to optimization and guided generation. Building on this view, we propose a new training loss for cost predictors and a density-gradient optimization method that improves objectives while preserving plausible shapes. We further unify existing training-free guided generation methods. To address their inability to approximate conditional covariance in high dimensions, we develop a time- and memory-efficient algorithm for approximate covariance estimation. Experiments on a controlled 2D study and high-fidelity 3D aerodynamic benchmarks (car and aircraft), validated by OpenFOAM simulations and miniature wind-tunnel tests with 3D-printed prototypes, demonstrate consistent gains in both optimization and guided generation. Additional offline RL results further support the generality of our approach.]]></description>

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables large language models to invoke external tools through natural-language descriptions, forming the foundation of many AI agent applications. However, MCP does not enforce consistency between documented tool behavior and actual code execution, even though MCP Servers often run with broad system privileges. This gap introduces a largely unexplored security risk. We study how mismatches between externally presented tool descriptions and underlying implementations systematically shape the mental models and decision-making behavior of intelligent agents. Specifically, we present the first large-scale study of description-code inconsistency in the MCP ecosystem. We design an automated static analysis framework and apply it to 10,240 real-world MCP Servers across 36 categories. Our results show that while most servers are highly consistent, approximately 13% exhibit substantial mismatches that can enable undocumented privileged operations, hidden state mutations, or unauthorized financial actions. We further observe systematic differences across application categories, popularity levels, and MCP marketplaces. Our findings demonstrate that description-code inconsistency is a concrete and prevalent attack surface in MCP-based AI agents, and motivate the need for systematic auditing and stronger transparency guarantees in future agent ecosystems.]]></description>

Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to hallucinations and outdated parametric knowledge. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by integrating external corpora, its effectiveness is limited by fragmented information in unstructured domain documents. Graph-augmented RAG (GraphRAG) emerged to enhance contextual reasoning through structured knowledge graphs, yet paradoxically underperforms vanilla RAG in real-world scenarios, exhibiting significant accuracy drops and prohibitive latency despite gains on complex queries. We identify the rigid application of GraphRAG to all queries, regardless of complexity, as the root cause. To resolve this, we propose an efficient and adaptive GraphRAG framework called EA-GraphRAG that dynamically integrates RAG and GraphRAG paradigms through syntax-aware complexity analysis. Our approach introduces: (i) a syntactic feature constructor that parses each query and extracts a set of structural features; (ii) a lightweight complexity scorer that maps these features to a continuous complexity score; and (iii) a score-driven routing policy that selects dense RAG for low-score queries, invokes graph-based retrieval for high-score queries, and applies complexity-aware reciprocal rank fusion to handle borderline cases. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive benchmark, consisting of two single-hop and two multi-hop QA benchmarks, demonstrate that our EA-GraphRAG significantly improves accuracy, reduces latency, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in handling mixed scenarios involving both simple and complex queries.]]></description>

Audio-visual joint representation learning under Cross-Modal Generalization (CMG) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source modality to an unlabeled target modality through a unified discrete representation space. Existing symmetric frameworks often suffer from information allocation ambiguity, where the absence of structural inductive bias leads to semantic-specific leakage across modalities. We propose Asymmetric Hierarchical Anchoring (AHA), which enforces directional information allocation by designating a structured semantic anchor within a shared hierarchy. In our instantiation, we exploit the hierarchical discrete representations induced by audio Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) to guide video feature distillation into a shared semantic space. To ensure representational purity, we replace fragile mutual information estimators with a GRL-based adversarial decoupler that explicitly suppresses semantic leakage in modality-specific branches, and introduce Local Sliding Alignment (LSA) to encourage fine-grained temporal alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on AVE and AVVP benchmarks demonstrate that AHA consistently outperforms symmetric baselines in cross-modal transfer. Additional analyses on talking-face disentanglement experiment further validate that the learned representations exhibit improved semantic consistency and disentanglement, indicating the broader applicability of the proposed framework.]]></description>

World models offer a principled framework for simulating future states under interventions, but realizing such models in complex, high-stakes domains like medicine remains challenging. Recent large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance on static medical reasoning tasks, raising the question of whether they can function as dynamic medical world models capable of simulating disease progression and treatment outcomes over time. In this work, we show that LLMs only incorporating medical knowledge struggle to maintain consistent patient states under sequential interventions, leading to error accumulation in long-horizon clinical simulation. To address this limitation, we introduce EHRWorld, a patient-centric medical world model trained under a causal sequential paradigm, together with EHRWorld-110K, a large-scale longitudinal clinical dataset derived from real-world electronic health records. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that EHRWorld significantly outperforms naive LLM-based baselines, achieving more stable long-horizon simulation, improved modeling of clinically sensitive events, and favorable reasoning efficiency, highlighting the necessity of training on causally grounded, temporally evolving clinical data for reliable and robust medical world modeling.]]></description>

Verifying whether the machine unlearning process has been properly executed is critical but remains underexplored. Some existing approaches propose unlearning verification methods based on backdooring techniques. However, these methods typically require participation in the model's initial training phase to backdoor the model for later verification, which is inefficient and impractical. In this paper, we propose an efficient verification of erasure method (EVE) for verifying machine unlearning without requiring involvement in the model's initial training process. The core idea is to perturb the unlearning data to ensure the model prediction of the specified samples will change before and after unlearning with perturbed data. The unlearning users can leverage the observation of the changes as a verification signal. Specifically, the perturbations are designed with two key objectives: ensuring the unlearning effect and altering the unlearned model's prediction of target samples. We formalize the perturbation generation as an adversarial optimization problem, solving it by aligning the unlearning gradient with the gradient of boundary change for target samples. We conducted extensive experiments, and the results show that EVE can verify machine unlearning without involving the model's initial training process, unlike backdoor-based methods. Moreover, EVE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unlearning verification methods, offering significant speedup in efficiency while enhancing verification accuracy. The source code of EVE is released at \uline{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EVE-C143}, providing a novel tool for verification of machine unlearning.]]></description>

Computational optimal transport (OT) offers a principled framework for generative modeling. Neural OT methods, which use neural networks to learn an OT map (or potential) from data in an amortized way, can be evaluated out of sample after training, but existing approaches are tailored to Euclidean geometry. Extending neural OT to high-dimensional Riemannian manifolds remains an open challenge. In this paper, we prove that any method for OT on manifolds that produces discrete approximations of transport maps necessarily suffers from the curse of dimensionality: achieving a fixed accuracy requires a number of parameters that grows exponentially with the manifold dimension. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce Riemannian Neural OT (RNOT) maps, which are continuous neural-network parameterizations of OT maps on manifolds that avoid discretization and incorporate geometric structure by construction. Under mild regularity assumptions, we prove that RNOT maps approximate Riemannian OT maps with sub-exponential complexity in the dimension. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate improved scalability and competitive performance relative to discretization-based baselines.]]></description>

Time series forecasting can be viewed as a generative problem that requires both semantic understanding over contextual conditions and stochastic modeling of continuous temporal dynamics. Existing approaches typically rely on either autoregressive large language models (LLMs) for semantic context modeling or diffusion-like models for continuous probabilistic generation. However, neither method alone can adequately model both aspects simultaneously. In this work, we propose CoGenCast, a hybrid generative framework that couples pre-trained LLMs with flow-matching mechanism for effective time series forecasting. Specifically, we reconfigure pre-trained decoder-only LLMs into a native forecasting encoder-decoder backbone by modifying only the attention topology, enabling bidirectional context encoding and causal representation generation. Building on this, a flow-matching mechanism is further integrated to model temporal evolution, capturing continuous stochastic dynamics conditioned on the autoregressively generated representation. Notably, CoGenCast naturally supports multimodal forecasting and cross-domain unified training. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that CoGenCast consistently outperforms previous compared baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/liuyaguo/_CoGenCast.]]></description>

Despite its success in self-supervised learning, contrastive learning is less studied in the supervised setting. In this work, we first use a set of pilot experiments to show that in the supervised setting, the cross-entropy loss objective (CE) and the contrastive learning objective often conflict with each other, thus hindering the applications of CL in supervised settings. To resolve this problem, we introduce a novel \underline{A}ligned \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{L}earning (ACL) framework. First, ACL-Embed regards label embeddings as extra augmented samples with different labels and employs contrastive learning to align the label embeddings with its samples' representations. Second, to facilitate the optimization of ACL-Embed objective combined with the CE loss, we propose ACL-Grad, which will discard the ACL-Embed term if the two objectives are in conflict. To further enhance the performances of intermediate exits of multi-exit BERT, we further propose cross-layer ACL (ACL-CL), which is to ask the teacher exit to guide the optimization of student shallow exits. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark results in the following takeaways: (a) ACL-BRT outperforms or performs comparably with CE and CE+SCL on the GLUE tasks; (b) ACL, especially CL-ACL, significantly surpasses the baseline methods on the fine-tuning of multi-exit BERT, thus providing better quality-speed tradeoffs for low-latency applications.]]></description>

Sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome. Identifying clinically distinct phenotypes may enable more precise treatment strategies. In recent years, many researchers have applied clustering algorithms to sepsis patients. However, the clustering process rarely incorporates clinical relevance, potentially limiting to reflect clinically distinct phenotypes. We propose NPCNet, a novel deep clustering network with a target navigator that integrates temporal Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to better align sepsis phenotypes with clinical significance. We identify four sepsis phenotypes ($α$, $β$, $γ$, and $δ$) with divergence in SOFA trajectories. Notably, while $α$ and $δ$ phenotypes both show severe conditions in the early stage, NPCNet effectively differentiates patients who are likely to improve ($α$) from those at risk of deterioration ($δ$). Furthermore, through the treatment effect analysis, we discover that $α$, $β$, and $δ$ phenotypes may benefit from early vasopressor administration. The results show that NPCNet enhances precision treatment strategies by uncovering clinically distinct phenotypes.]]></description>

This work introduces Hybrid Sparse Attention (HySparse), a new architecture that interleaves each full attention layer with several sparse attention layers. While conceptually simple, HySparse strategically derives each sparse layer's token selection and KV caches directly from the preceding full attention layer. This architecture resolves two fundamental limitations of prior sparse attention methods. First, conventional approaches typically rely on additional proxies to predict token importance, introducing extra complexity and potentially suboptimal performance. In contrast, HySparse uses the full attention layer as a precise oracle to identify important tokens. Second, existing sparse attention designs often reduce computation without saving KV cache. HySparse enables sparse attention layers to reuse the full attention KV cache, thereby reducing both computation and memory. We evaluate HySparse on both 7B dense and 80B MoE models. Across all settings, HySparse consistently outperforms both full attention and hybrid SWA baselines. Notably, in the 80B MoE model with 49 total layers, only 5 layers employ full attention, yet HySparse achieves substantial performance gains while reducing KV cache storage by nearly 10x.]]></description>

Generative text-to-image models are advancing at an unprecedented pace, continuously shifting the perceptual quality ceiling and rendering previously collected labels unreliable for newer generations. To address this, we present ELIQ, a Label-free Framework for Quality Assessment of Evolving AI-generated Images. Specifically, ELIQ focuses on visual quality and prompt-image alignment, automatically constructs positive and aspect-specific negative pairs to cover both conventional distortions and AIGC-specific distortion modes, enabling transferable supervision without human annotations. Building on these pairs, ELIQ adapts a pre-trained multimodal model into a quality-aware critic via instruction tuning and predicts two-dimensional quality using lightweight gated fusion and a Quality Query Transformer. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ELIQ consistently outperforms existing label-free methods, generalizes from AI-generated content (AIGC) to user-generated content (UGC) scenarios without modification, and paves the way for scalable and label-free quality assessment under continuously evolving generative models. The code will be released upon publication.]]></description>

Multi-organ segmentation is a widely applied clinical routine and automated organ segmentation tools dramatically improve the pipeline of the radiologists. Recently, deep learning (DL) based segmentation models have shown the capacity to accomplish such a task. However, the training of the segmentation networks requires large amount of data with manual annotations, which is a major concern due to the data scarcity from clinic. Working with limited data is still common for researches on novel imaging modalities. To enhance the effectiveness of DL models trained with limited data, data augmentation (DA) is a crucial regularization technique. Traditional DA (TDA) strategies focus on basic intra-image operations, i.e. generating images with different orientations and intensity distributions. In contrast, the interimage and object-level DA operations are able to create new images from separate individuals. However, such DA strategies are not well explored on the task of multi-organ segmentation. In this paper, we investigated four possible inter-image DA strategies: CutMix, CarveMix, ObjectAug and AnatoMix, on two organ segmentation datasets. The result shows that CutMix, CarveMix and AnatoMix can improve the average dice score by 4.9, 2.0 and 1.9, compared with the state-of-the-art nnUNet without DA strategies. These results can be further improved by adding TDA strategies. It is revealed in our experiments that Cut-Mix is a robust but simple DA strategy to drive up the segmentation performance for multi-organ segmentation, even when CutMix produces intuitively 'wrong' images. Our implementation is publicly available for future benchmarks.]]></description>

Recent progress has expanded the use of large language models (LLMs) in drug discovery, including synthesis planning. However, objective evaluation of retrosynthesis performance remains limited. Existing benchmarks and metrics typically rely on published synthetic procedures and Top-K accuracy based on single ground-truth, which does not capture the open-ended nature of real-world synthesis planning. We propose a new benchmarking framework for single-step retrosynthesis that evaluates both general-purpose and chemistry-specialized LLMs using ChemCensor, a novel metric for chemical plausibility. By emphasizing plausibility over exact match, this approach better aligns with human synthesis planning practices. We also introduce CREED, a novel dataset comprising millions of ChemCensor-validated reaction records for LLM training, and use it to train a model that improves over the LLM baselines under this benchmark.]]></description>

Despite major advances in multilingual modeling, large quality disparities persist across languages. Besides the obvious impact of uneven training resources, typological properties have also been proposed to determine the intrinsic difficulty of modeling a language. The existing evidence, however, is mostly based on small monolingual language models or bilingual translation models trained from scratch. We expand on this line of work by analyzing two large pre-trained multilingual translation models, NLLB-200 and Tower+, which are state-of-the-art representatives of encoder-decoder and decoder-only machine translation, respectively. Based on a broad set of languages, we find that target language typology drives translation quality of both models, even after controlling for more trivial factors, such as data resourcedness and writing script. Additionally, languages with certain typological properties benefit more from a wider search of the output space, suggesting that such languages could profit from alternative decoding strategies beyond the standard left-to-right beam search. To facilitate further research in this area, we release a set of fine-grained typological properties for 212 languages of the FLORES+ MT evaluation benchmark.]]></description>

Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in open-domain dialogues. However, current methods exhibit suboptimal performance in service dialogues, as they rely on noisy, low-quality human conversation data. This limitation arises from data scarcity and the difficulty of simulating authentic, goal-oriented user behaviors. To address these issues, we propose SEAD (Self-Evolving Agent for Service Dialogue), a framework that enables agents to learn effective strategies without large-scale human annotations. SEAD decouples user modeling into two components: a Profile Controller that generates diverse user states to manage training curriculum, and a User Role-play Model that focuses on realistic role-playing. This design ensures the environment provides adaptive training scenarios rather than acting as an unfair adversary. Experiments demonstrate that SEAD significantly outperforms Open-source Foundation Models and Closed-source Commercial Models, improving task completion rate by 17.6% and dialogue efficiency by 11.1%. Code is available at: https://github.com/Da1yuqin/SEAD.]]></description>

We introduce AffordanceGrasp-R1, a reasoning-driven affordance segmentation framework for robotic grasping that combines a chain-of-thought (CoT) cold-start strategy with reinforcement learning to enhance deduction and spatial grounding. In addition, we redesign the grasping pipeline to be more context-aware by generating grasp candidates from the global scene point cloud and subsequently filtering them using instruction-conditioned affordance masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordanceGrasp-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on benchmark datasets, and real-world robotic grasping evaluations further validate its robustness and generalization under complex language-conditioned manipulation scenarios.]]></description>

Machine learning is a powerful method of extracting meaning from data; unfortunately, current digital hardware is extremely energy-intensive. There is interest in an alternative analog computing implementation that could match the performance of traditional machine learning while being significantly more energy-efficient. However, it remains unclear how to train such analog computing systems while adhering to locality constraints imposed by the physical (as opposed to digital) nature of these systems. Local learning algorithms such as Equilibrium Propagation and Coupled Learning have been proposed to address this issue. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to exactly calculate gradients using a graph theoretic and analytical framework for Kirchhoff's laws. We also introduce Generalized Equilibrium Propagation, a framework encompassing a broad class of Hebbian learning algorithms, including Coupled Learning and Equilibrium Propagation, and show how our algorithm compares. We demonstrate our algorithm using numerical simulations and show that we can train resistor networks without the need for a replica or readout over all resistors, only at the output layer. We also show that under the analytical gradient approach, it is possible to update only a subset of the resistance values without a strong degradation in performance.]]></description>

Evaluating AI systems that interact with humans requires understanding their behavior across diverse user populations, but collecting representative human data is often expensive or infeasible, particularly for novel technologies or hypothetical future scenarios. Recent work in Generative Agent-Based Modeling has shown that large language models can simulate human-like synthetic personas with high fidelity, accurately reproducing the beliefs and behaviors of specific individuals. However, most approaches require detailed data about target populations and often prioritize density matching (replicating what is most probable) rather than support coverage (spanning what is possible), leaving long-tail behaviors underexplored. We introduce Persona Generators, functions that can produce diverse synthetic populations tailored to arbitrary contexts. We apply an iterative improvement loop based on AlphaEvolve, using large language models as mutation operators to refine our Persona Generator code over hundreds of iterations. The optimization process produces lightweight Persona Generators that can automatically expand small descriptions into populations of diverse synthetic personas that maximize coverage of opinions and preferences along relevant diversity axes. We demonstrate that evolved generators substantially outperform existing baselines across six diversity metrics on held-out contexts, producing populations that span rare trait combinations difficult to achieve in standard LLM outputs.]]></description>

Large language models (LLMs) are trained and tested extensively on symbolic representations such as code and graphs, yet real-world user tasks are often specified in natural language. To what extent can LLMs generalize across these representations? Here, we approach this question by studying isomorphic tasks involving procedures represented in code, graphs, and natural language (e.g., scheduling steps in planning). We find that training LLMs with popular post-training methods on graphs or code data alone does not reliably generalize to corresponding natural language tasks, while training solely on natural language can lead to inefficient performance gains. To address this gap, we propose a two-stage data curriculum that first trains on symbolic, then natural language data. The curriculum substantially improves model performance across model families and tasks. Remarkably, a 1.5B Qwen model trained by our method can closely match zero-shot GPT-4o in naturalistic planning. Finally, our analysis suggests that successful cross-representation generalization can be interpreted as a form of generative analogy, which our curriculum effectively encourages.]]></description>

Reliance on generative AI can reduce cultural variance and diversity, especially in creative work. This reduction in variance has already led to problems in model performance, including model collapse and hallucination. In this paper, we examine the long-term consequences of AI use for human cultural evolution and the conditions under which widespread AI use may lead to "cultural collapse", a process in which reliance on AI-generated content reduces human variation and innovation and slows cumulative cultural evolution. Using an agent-based model and evolutionary game theory, we compare two types of AI use: complement and substitute. AI-complement users seek suggestions and guidance while remaining the main producers of the final output, whereas AI-substitute users provide minimal input, and rely on AI to produce most of the output. We then study how these use strategies compete and spread under evolutionary dynamics. We find that AI-substitute users prevail under individual-level selection despite the stronger reduction in cultural variance. By contrast, AI-complement users can benefit their groups by maintaining the variance needed for exploration, and can therefore be favored under cultural group selection when group boundaries are strong. Overall, our findings shed light on the long-term, population-level effects of AI adoption and inform policy and organizational strategies to mitigate these risks.]]></description>

While Dynamic Gaussian Splatting enables high-fidelity 4D reconstruction, its deployment is severely hindered by a fundamental dilemma: unconstrained densification leads to excessive memory consumption incompatible with edge devices, whereas heuristic pruning fails to achieve optimal rendering quality under preset Gaussian budgets. In this work, we propose Constrained Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (CDGS), a novel framework that formulates dynamic scene reconstruction as a budget-constrained optimization problem to enforce a strict, user-defined Gaussian budget during training. Our key insight is to introduce a differentiable budget controller as the core optimization driver. Guided by a multi-modal unified importance score, this controller fuses geometric, motion, and perceptual cues for precise capacity regulation. To maximize the utility of this fixed budget, we further decouple the optimization of static and dynamic elements, employing an adaptive allocation mechanism that dynamically distributes capacity based on motion complexity. Furthermore, we implement a three-phase training strategy to seamlessly integrate these constraints, ensuring precise adherence to the target count. Coupled with a dual-mode hybrid compression scheme, CDGS not only strictly adheres to hardware constraints (error < 2%}) but also pushes the Pareto frontier of rate-distortion performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDGS delivers optimal rendering quality under varying capacity limits, achieving over 3x compression compared to state-of-the-art methods.]]></description>

Matryoshka Quantization (MatQuant) is a recent quantization approach showing that a single integer-quantized model can be served across multiple precisions, by slicing the most significant bits (MSB) at inference time. This enables a single checkpoint to cover a wide range of memory and latency budgets, but renders quantization much more challenging. In particular, the initial MatQuant relies on expensive quantization-aware training (QAT) variants, rather than fast one-shot post training quantization (PTQ), and lacks open-source and kernel support. We address all of these limitations by introducing Post-Training Matryoshka Quantization (MatGPTQ), a new PTQ pipeline that produces a single parent model jointly optimized for multiple target precisions in one-shot, based on a small calibration set. MatGPTQ casts Matryoshka quantization as a multi-precision objective with bit-slicing and cross-bit error compensation, resulting in an algorithm that produces a multi-bit-width, "sliceable" model in a single pass. We also incorporate a new budget-aware search for heterogeneous per-layer bit-witdhs and provide efficient kernels that implement slicing and mixed-precision execution. Across standard LLMs and benchmarks, MatGPTQ preserves high-bit accuracy while substantially improving performance at low-bit-witdh settings. Overall, we establish a new state of the art for Matryoshka-style post-training quantization and make single-checkpoint, multi-precision deployment open and practical. Code is available at https://github.com/IST-DASLab/MatGPTQ.]]></description>

We introduce a dynamic sparse training algorithm based on linearized Bregman iterations / mirror descent that exploits the naturally incurred sparsity by alternating between periods of static and dynamic sparsity pattern updates. The key idea is to combine sparsity-inducing Bregman iterations with adaptive freezing of the network structure to enable efficient exploration of the sparse parameter space while maintaining sparsity. We provide convergence guaranties by embedding our method in a multilevel optimization framework. Furthermore, we empirically show that our algorithm can produce highly sparse and accurate models on standard benchmarks. We also show that the theoretical number of FLOPs compared to SGD training can be reduced from 38% for standard Bregman iterations to 6% for our method while maintaining test accuracy.]]></description>

The rapid progress of large multimodal models has inspired efforts toward unified frameworks that couple understanding and generation. While such paradigms have shown remarkable success in 2D, extending them to 3D remains largely underexplored. Existing attempts to unify 3D tasks under a single autoregressive (AR) paradigm lead to significant performance degradation due to forced signal quantization and prohibitive training cost. Our key insight is that the essential challenge lies not in enforcing a unified autoregressive paradigm, but in enabling effective information interaction between generation and understanding while minimally compromising their inherent capabilities and leveraging pretrained models to reduce training cost. Guided by this perspective, we present the first unified framework for 3D understanding and generation that combines autoregression with diffusion. Specifically, we adopt an autoregressive next-token prediction paradigm for 3D understanding, and a continuous diffusion paradigm for 3D generation. A lightweight transformer bridges the feature space of large language models and the conditional space of 3D diffusion models, enabling effective cross-modal information exchange while preserving the priors learned by standalone models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse 3D understanding and generation benchmarks, while also excelling in 3D editing tasks. These results highlight the potential of unified AR+diffusion models as a promising direction for building more general-purpose 3D intelligence.]]></description>

Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) achieve impressive performance in image classification tasks, yet the internal representations they learn remain less understood. This work started as an attempt to understand the strong downstream classification performance of MAE. In this process we discover that representations learned with the pretraining and fine-tuning, are quite robust - demonstrating a good classification performance in the presence of degradations, such as blur and occlusions. Through layer-wise analysis of token embeddings, we show that pretrained MAE progressively constructs its latent space in a class-aware manner across network depth: embeddings from different classes lie in subspaces that become increasingly separable. We further observe that MAE exhibits early and persistent global attention across encoder layers, in contrast to standard Vision Transformers (ViTs). To quantify feature robustness, we introduce two sensitivity indicators: directional alignment between clean and perturbed embeddings, and head-wise retention of active features under degradations. These studies help establish the robust classification performance of MAEs.]]></description>

Logical anomalies are violations of predefined constraints on object quantity, spatial layout, and compositional relationships in industrial images. While prior work largely treats anomaly detection as a binary decision, such formulations cannot indicate which logical rule is broken and therefore offer limited value for quality assurance. We introduce Logical Anomaly Classification (LAC), a task that unifies anomaly detection and fine-grained violation classification in a single inference step. To tackle LAC, we propose LogiCls, a vision-language framework that decomposes complex logical constraints into a sequence of verifiable subqueries. We further present a data-centric instruction synthesis pipeline that generates chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision for these subqueries, coupling precise grounding annotations with diverse image-text augmentations to adapt vision language models (VLMs) to logic-sensitive reasoning. Training is stabilized by a difficulty-aware resampling strategy that emphasizes challenging subqueries and long tail constraint types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LogiCls delivers robust, interpretable, and accurate industrial logical anomaly classification, providing both the predicted violation categories and their evidence trails.]]></description>

Video streaming is a fundamental Internet service, while the quality still cannot be guaranteed especially in poor network conditions such as bandwidth-constrained and remote areas. Existing works mainly work towards two directions: traditional pixel-codec streaming nearly approaches its limit and is hard to step further in compression; the emerging neural-enhanced or generative streaming usually fall short in latency and visual fidelity, hindering their practical deployment. Inspired by the recent success of vision foundation model (VFM), we strive to harness the powerful video understanding and processing capacities of VFM to achieve generalization, high fidelity and loss resilience for real-time video streaming with even higher compression rate. We present the first revolutionized paradigm that enables VFM-based end-to-end generative video streaming towards this goal. Specifically, Morphe employs joint training of visual tokenizers and variable-resolution spatiotemporal optimization under simulated network constraints. Additionally, a robust streaming system is constructed that leverages intelligent packet dropping to resist real-world network perturbations. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that Morphe achieves comparable visual quality while saving 62.5\% bandwidth compared to H.265, and accomplishes real-time, loss-resilient video delivery in challenging network environments, representing a milestone in VFM-enabled multimedia streaming solutions.]]></description>

Fast and efficient AI inference is increasingly important, and recent models that directly learn low-level logic operations have achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, existing logic neural networks incur high training costs, introduce redundancy or rely on approximate gradients, which limits scalability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce WAlsh Relaxation for Probabilistic (WARP) logic neural networks -- a novel gradient-based framework that efficiently learns combinations of hardware-native logic blocks. We show that WARP yields the most parameter-efficient representation for exactly learning Boolean functions and that several prior approaches arise as restricted special cases. Training is improved by introducing learnable thresholding and residual initialization, while we bridge the gap between relaxed training and discrete logic inference through stochastic smoothing. Experiments demonstrate faster convergence than state-of-the-art baselines, while scaling effectively to deeper architectures and logic functions with higher input arity.]]></description>

Generating piano accompaniments in the symbolic music domain is a challenging task that requires producing a complete piece of piano music from given melody and chord constraints, such as those provided by a lead sheet. In this paper, we propose a discrete diffusion-based piano accompaniment generation model, D3PIA, leveraging local alignment between lead sheet and accompaniment in piano-roll representation. D3PIA incorporates Neighborhood Attention (NA) to both encode the lead sheet and condition it for predicting note states in the piano accompaniment. This design enhances local contextual modeling by efficiently attending to nearby melody and chord conditions. We evaluate our model using the POP909 dataset, a widely used benchmark for piano accompaniment generation. Objective evaluation results demonstrate that D3PIA preserves chord conditions more faithfully compared to continuous diffusion-based and Transformer-based baselines. Furthermore, a subjective listening test indicates that D3PIA generates more musically coherent accompaniments than the comparison models.]]></description>

Live streaming has become a cornerstone of today's internet, enabling massive real-time social interactions. However, it faces severe risks arising from sparse, coordinated malicious behaviors among multiple participants, which are often concealed within normal activities and challenging to detect timely and accurately. In this work, we provide a pioneering study on risk assessment in live streaming rooms, characterized by weak supervision where only room-level labels are available. We formulate the task as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem, treating each room as a bag and defining structured user-timeslot capsules as instances. These capsules represent subsequences of user actions within specific time windows, encapsulating localized behavioral patterns. Based on this formulation, we propose AC-MIL, an Action-aware Capsule MIL framework that models both individual behaviors and group-level coordination patterns. AC-MIL captures multi-granular semantics and behavioral cues through a serial and parallel architecture that jointly encodes temporal dynamics and cross-user dependencies. These signals are integrated for robust room-level risk prediction, while also offering interpretable evidence at the behavior segment level. Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets from Douyin demonstrate that AC-MIL significantly outperforms MIL and sequential baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in room-level risk assessment for live streaming. Moreover, AC-MIL provides capsule-level interpretability, enabling identification of risky behavior segments as actionable evidence for intervention.

Many decision-making problems require ranking individuals by their treatment effects rather than estimating the exact effect magnitudes. Examples include prioritizing patients for preventive care interventions, or ranking customers by the expected incremental impact of an advertisement. Surprisingly, while causal effect estimation has received substantial attention in the literature, the problem of directly learning rankings of treatment effects has largely remained unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Rank-Learner, a novel two-stage learner that directly learns the ranking of treatment effects from observational data. We first show that naive approaches based on precise treatment effect estimation solve a harder problem than necessary for ranking, while our Rank-Learner optimizes a pairwise learning objective that recovers the true treatment effect ordering, without explicit CATE estimation. We further show that our Rank-Learner is Neyman-orthogonal and thus comes with strong theoretical guarantees, including robustness to estimation errors in the nuisance functions. In addition, our Rank-Learner is model-agnostic, and can be instantiated with arbitrary machine learning models (e.g., neural networks). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments where Rank-Learner consistently outperforms standard CATE estimators and non-orthogonal ranking methods. Overall, we provide practitioners with a new, orthogonal two-stage learner for ranking individuals by their treatment effects.]]></description>

Learning from negative samples holds great promise for improving Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning capability, yet existing methods treat all incorrect responses as equally informative, overlooking the crucial role of sample quality. To address this, we propose Plausible Negative Samples (PNS), a method that synthesizes high-quality negative samples exhibiting expected format and structural coherence while ultimately yielding incorrect answers. PNS trains a dedicated model via reverse reinforcement learning (RL) guided by a composite reward combining format compliance, accuracy inversion, reward model assessment, and chain-of-thought evaluation, generating responses nearly indistinguishable from correct solutions. We further validate PNS as a plug-and-play data source for preference optimization across three backbone models on seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Results demonstrate that PNS consistently outperforms other negative sample synthesis methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.03% over RL-trained models.]]></description>

Asynchronous pipeline parallelism maximizes hardware utilization by eliminating the pipeline bubbles inherent in synchronous execution, offering a path toward efficient large-scale distributed training. However, this efficiency gain can be compromised by gradient staleness, where the immediate model updates with delayed gradients introduce noise into the optimization process. Crucially, we identify a critical, yet often overlooked, pathology: this delay scales linearly with pipeline depth, fundamentally undermining the very scalability that the method originally intends to provide. In this work, we investigate this inconsistency and bridge the gap by rectifying delayed gradients through basis rotation, restoring scalable asynchronous training while maintaining performance. Specifically, we observe that the deleterious effects of delayed gradients are exacerbated when the Hessian eigenbasis is misaligned with the standard coordinate basis. We demonstrate that this misalignment prevents coordinate-wise adaptive schemes, such as Adam, from effectively leveraging curvature-aware adaptivity. This failure leads to significant oscillations in the optimization trajectory and, consequently, slower convergence. We substantiate these findings through both rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. To address this challenge, we propose the use of basis rotation, demonstrating that it effectively mitigates the alignment issue and significantly accelerates convergence in asynchronous settings. For example, our training of a 1B-parameter LLM with basis rotation achieves the same training loss in 76.8% fewer iterations compared to the best-performing asynchronous pipeline parallel training baseline.]]></description>

Modern learning systems often interpolate training data while still generalizing well, yet it remains unclear when algorithmic stability explains this behavior. We model training as a function-space trajectory and measure sensitivity to single-sample perturbations along this trajectory.
  We propose a contractive propagation condition and a stability certificate obtained by unrolling the resulting recursion. A small certificate implies stability-based generalization, while we also prove that there exist interpolating regimes with small risk where such contractive sensitivity cannot hold, showing that stability is not a universal explanation.
  Experiments confirm that certificate growth predicts generalization differences across optimizers, step sizes, and dataset perturbations. The framework therefore identifies regimes where stability explains generalization and where alternative mechanisms must account for success.]]></description>

Robust disturbance rejection remains a longstanding challenge in humanoid locomotion, particularly on unstructured terrains where sensing is unreliable and model mismatch is pronounced. While perception information, such as height map, enhances terrain awareness, sensor noise and sim-to-real gaps can destabilize policies in practice. In this work, we provide theoretical analysis that bounds the return gap under observation noise, when the induced latent dynamics are contractive. Furthermore, we present Contractive Mapping for Robustness (CMR) framework that maps high-dimensional, disturbance-prone observations into a latent space, where local perturbations are attenuated over time. Specifically, this approach couples contrastive representation learning with Lipschitz regularization to preserve task-relevant geometry while explicitly controlling sensitivity. Notably, the formulation can be incorporated into modern deep reinforcement learning pipelines as an auxiliary loss term with minimal additional technical effort required. Further, our extensive humanoid experiments show that CMR potently outperforms other locomotion algorithms under increased noise.]]></description>

Recent DiT-based text-to-image models increasingly adopt LLMs as text encoders, yet text conditioning remains largely static and often utilizes only a single LLM layer, despite pronounced semantic hierarchy across LLM layers and non-stationary denoising dynamics over both diffusion time and network depth. To better match the dynamic process of DiT generation and thereby enhance the diffusion model's generative capability, we introduce a unified normalized convex fusion framework equipped with lightweight gates to systematically organize multi-layer LLM hidden states via time-wise, depth-wise, and joint fusion. Experiments establish Depth-wise Semantic Routing as the superior conditioning strategy, consistently improving text-image alignment and compositional generation (e.g., +9.97 on the GenAI-Bench Counting task). Conversely, we find that purely time-wise fusion can paradoxically degrade visual generation fidelity. We attribute this to a train-inference trajectory mismatch: under classifier-free guidance, nominal timesteps fail to track the effective SNR, causing semantically mistimed feature injection during inference. Overall, our results position depth-wise routing as a strong and effective baseline and highlight the critical need for trajectory-aware signals to enable robust time-dependent conditioning.]]></description>

Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has markedly improved the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. However, most RLVR pipelines rely on sparse outcome-based rewards, providing little supervision over intermediate steps and thus encouraging over-confidence and spurious reasoning, which in turn increases hallucinations. To address this, we propose FaithRL, a general reinforcement learning framework that directly optimizes reasoning faithfulness. We formalize a faithfulness-maximization objective and theoretically show that optimizing it mitigates over-confidence. To instantiate this objective, we introduce a geometric reward design and a faithfulness-aware advantage modulation mechanism that assigns step-level credit by penalizing unsupported steps while preserving valid partial derivations. Across diverse backbones and benchmarks, FaithRL consistently reduces hallucination rates while maintaining (and often improving) answer correctness. Further analysis confirms that FaithRL increases step-wise reasoning faithfulness and generalizes robustly. Our code is available at https://github.com/aintdoin/FaithRL.]]></description>

Following their success across many domains, transformers have also proven effective for symbolic regression (SR); however, the internal mechanisms underlying their generation of mathematical operators remain largely unexplored. Although mechanistic interpretability has successfully identified circuits in language and vision models, it has not yet been applied to SR. In this article, we introduce PATCHES, an evolutionary circuit discovery algorithm that identifies compact and correct circuits for SR. Using PATCHES, we isolate 28 circuits, providing the first circuit-level characterisation of an SR transformer. We validate these findings through a robust causal evaluation framework based on key notions such as faithfulness, completeness, and minimality. Our analysis shows that mean patching with performance-based evaluation most reliably isolates functionally correct circuits. In contrast, we demonstrate that direct logit attribution and probing classifiers primarily capture correlational features rather than causal ones, limiting their utility for circuit discovery. Overall, these results establish SR as a high-potential application domain for mechanistic interpretability and propose a principled methodology for circuit discovery.]]></description>

This paper addresses optimal decoding strategies in lossy compression where the assumed distribution for compressor design mismatches the actual (true) distribution of the source. This problem has immediate relevance in standardized communication systems where the decoder acquires side information or priors about the true distribution that are unavailable to the fixed encoder. We formally define the mismatched quantization problem, demonstrating that the optimal reconstruction rule, termed generative decompression, aligns with classical Bayesian estimation by taking the conditional expectation under the true distribution given the quantization indices and adapting it to fixed-encoder constraints. This strategy effectively performs a generative Bayesian correction on the decoder side, strictly outperforming the conventional centroid rule. We extend this framework to transmission over noisy channels, deriving a robust soft-decoding rule that quantifies the inefficiency of standard modular source--channel separation architectures under mismatch. Furthermore, we generalize the approach to task-oriented decoding, showing that the optimal strategy shifts from conditional mean estimation to maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection. Experimental results on Gaussian sources and deep-learning-based semantic classification demonstrate that generative decompression closes a vast majority of the performance gap to the ideal joint-optimization benchmark, enabling adaptive, high-fidelity reconstruction without modifying the encoder.]]></description>

Reparameterization Policy Gradient (RPG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for model-based reinforcement learning, enabling high sample efficiency by backpropagating gradients through differentiable dynamics. However, prior RPG approaches have been predominantly restricted to Gaussian policies, limiting their performance and failing to leverage recent advances in generative models. In this work, we identify that flow policies, which generate actions via differentiable ODE integration, naturally align with the RPG framework, a connection not established in prior work. However, naively exploiting this synergy proves ineffective, often suffering from training instability and a lack of exploration. We propose Reparameterization Flow Policy Optimization (RFO). RFO computes policy gradients by backpropagating jointly through the flow generation process and system dynamics, unlocking high sample efficiency without requiring intractable log-likelihood calculations. RFO includes two tailored regularization terms for stability and exploration. We also propose a variant of RFO with action chunking. Extensive experiments on diverse locomotion and manipulation tasks, involving both rigid and soft bodies with state or visual inputs, demonstrate the effectiveness of RFO. Notably, on a challenging locomotion task controlling a soft-body quadruped, RFO achieves almost $2\times$ the reward of the state-of-the-art baseline.]]></description>

Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) support arbitrary-order generation, yet their inference performance critically depends on the unmasking order. Existing strategies rely on heuristics that greedily optimize local confidence, offering limited guidance for identifying unmasking paths that are globally consistent and accurate. To bridge this gap, we introduce path log-likelihood (Path LL), a trajectory-conditioned objective that strongly correlates with downstream accuracy and enables principled selection of unmasking paths. To optimize Path LL at inference time, we propose POKE, an efficient value estimator that predicts the expected future Path LL of a partial decoding trajectory. We then integrate this lookahead signal into POKE-SMC, a Sequential Monte Carlo-based search framework for dynamically identifying optimal unmasking paths. Extensive experiments across 6 reasoning tasks show that POKE-SMC consistently improves accuracy, achieving 2%--3% average gains over strong decoding-time scaling baselines at comparable inference overhead on LLaDA models and advancing the accuracy--compute Pareto frontier.]]></description>

Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures significantly enhance the capacity of LLMs without proportional increases in computation, but at the cost of a vast parameter size. Offloading MoE expert parameters to host memory and leveraging both CPU and GPU computation has recently emerged as a promising direction to support such models on resourceconstrained local PC platforms. While promising, we notice that existing approaches mismatch the dynamic nature of expert workloads, which leads to three fundamental inefficiencies: (1) Static expert assignment causes severe CPUGPU load imbalance, underutilizing CPU and GPU resources; (2) Existing prefetching techniques fail to accurately predict high-workload experts, leading to costly inaccurate prefetches; (3) GPU cache policies neglect workload dynamics, resulting in poor hit rates and limited effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose DALI, a workloaDAware offLoadIng framework for efficient MoE inference on local PCs. To fully utilize hardware resources, DALI first dynamically assigns experts to CPU or GPU by modeling assignment as a 0-1 integer optimization problem and solving it efficiently using a Greedy Assignment strategy at runtime. To improve prefetching accuracy, we develop a Residual-Based Prefetching method leveraging inter-layer residual information to accurately predict high-workload experts. Additionally, we introduce a Workload-Aware Cache Replacement policy that exploits temporal correlation in expert activations to improve GPU cache efficiency. By evaluating across various MoE models and settings, DALI achieves significant speedups in the both prefill and decoding phases over the state-of-the-art offloading frameworks.]]></description>

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods have emerged as crucial techniques for adapting large pre-trained models to downstream tasks under computational and memory constraints. However, they face a fundamental challenge in balancing task-specific performance gains against catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained knowledge, where existing methods provide inconsistent recommendations. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the performance-forgetting trade-offs inherent in low-rank adaptation using principal components as initialization. Our investigation reveals that fine-tuning intermediate components leads to better balance and show more robustness to high learning rates than first (PiSSA) and last (MiLoRA) components in existing work. Building on these findings, we provide a practical approach for initialization of LoRA that offers superior trade-offs. We demonstrate in a thorough empirical study on a variety of computer vision and NLP tasks that our approach improves accuracy and reduces forgetting, also in continual learning scenarios.]]></description>

Reasoning over table images remains challenging for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to complex layouts and tightly coupled structure-content information. Existing solutions often depend on expensive supervised training, reinforcement learning, or external tools, limiting efficiency and scalability. This work addresses a key question: how to adapt LVLMs to table reasoning with minimal annotation and no external tools? Specifically, we first introduce DiSCo, a Disentangled Structure-Content alignment framework that explicitly separates structural abstraction from semantic grounding during multimodal alignment, efficiently adapting LVLMs to tables structures. Building on DiSCo, we further present Table-GLS, a Global-to-Local Structure-guided reasoning framework that performs table reasoning via structured exploration and evidence-grounded inference. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our framework efficiently enhances LVLM's table understanding and reasoning capabilities, particularly generalizing to unseen table structures.]]></description>

Adaptive cognition requires structured internal models representing objects and their relations. Predictive neural networks are often proposed to form such "world models", yet their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. One hypothesis is that action-conditioned sequential prediction suffices for learning such world models. In this work, we investigate this possibility in a minimal in-silico setting. Sequentially sampling tokens from 2D continuous token scenes, a recurrent neural network is trained to predict the upcoming token from current input and a saccade-like displacement. On novel scenes, prediction accuracy improves across the sequence, indicating in-context learning. Decoding analyses reveal path integration and dynamic binding of token identity to position. Interventional analyses show that new bindings can be learned late in sequence and that out-of-distribution bindings can be learned. Together, these results demonstrate how structured representations that rely on flexible binding emerge to support prediction, offering a mechanistic account of sequential world modeling relevant to cognitive science.]]></description>

Integrating logical knowledge into deep neural network training is still a hard challenge, especially for sequential or temporally extended domains involving subsymbolic observations. To address this problem, we propose DeepDFA, a neurosymbolic framework that integrates high-level temporal logic - expressed as Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) or Moore Machines - into neural architectures. DeepDFA models temporal rules as continuous, differentiable layers, enabling symbolic knowledge injection into subsymbolic domains. We demonstrate how DeepDFA can be used in two key settings: (i) static image sequence classification, and (ii) policy learning in interactive non-Markovian environments. Across extensive experiments, DeepDFA outperforms traditional deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs, GRUs, Transformers) and novel neuro-symbolic systems, achieving state-of-the-art results in temporal knowledge integration. These results highlight the potential of DeepDFA to bridge subsymbolic learning and symbolic reasoning in sequential tasks.]]></description>

Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance by generating long reasoning traces with reflection. Through a large-scale empirical analysis, we find that a substantial fraction of reflective steps consist of self-verification (recheck) that repeatedly confirm intermediate results. These rechecks occur frequently across models and benchmarks, yet the vast majority are confirmatory rather than corrective, rarely identifying errors and altering reasoning outcomes. This reveals a mismatch between how often self-verification is activated and how often it is actually useful. Motivated by this, we propose a novel, experience-driven test-time framework that reduces the overused verification. Our method detects the activation of recheck behavior, consults an offline experience pool of past verification outcomes, and estimates whether a recheck is likely unnecessary via efficient retrieval. When historical experience suggests unnecessary, a suppression signal redirects the model to proceed. Across multiple model and benchmarks, our approach reduces token usage up to 20.3% while maintaining the accuracy, and in some datasets even yields accuracy improvements.]]></description>

In this study, we investigate how language models develop preferences for \textit{idiomatic} as compared to \textit{linguistically acceptable} Swedish, both during pretraining and when adapting a model from English to Swedish. To do so, we train models on Swedish from scratch and by fine-tuning English-pretrained models, probing their preferences at various checkpoints using minimal pairs that differ in linguistic acceptability or idiomaticity. For linguistic acceptability, we adapt existing benchmarks into a minimal-pair format. To assess idiomaticity, we introduce two novel datasets: one contrasting conventionalized idioms with plausible variants, and another contrasting idiomatic Swedish with Translationese. Our findings suggest that idiomatic competence emerges more slowly than other linguistic abilities, including grammatical and lexical correctness. While longer training yields diminishing returns for most tasks, idiom-related performance continues to improve, particularly in the largest model tested (8B). However, instruction tuning on data machine-translated from English -- the common approach for languages with little or no native instruction data -- causes models to rapidly lose their preference for idiomatic language.]]></description>

LLM routing aims to achieve a favorable quality--cost trade-off by dynamically assigning easy queries to smaller models and harder queries to stronger ones. However, across both unimodal and multimodal settings, we uncover a pervasive yet underexplored failure mode in existing routers: as the user's cost budget increases, routers systematically default to the most capable and most expensive model even when cheaper models already suffice. As a result, current routers under-utilize small models, wasting computation and monetary cost and undermining the core promise of routing; we term this phenomenon routing collapse. We attribute routing collapse to an objective--decision mismatch: many routers are trained to predict scalar performance scores, whereas routing decisions ultimately depend on discrete comparisons among candidate models. Consequently, small prediction errors can flip relative orderings and trigger suboptimal selections. To bridge this gap, we propose EquiRouter, a decision-aware router that directly learns model rankings, restoring the role of smaller models and mitigating routing collapse. On RouterBench, EquiRouter reduces cost by about 17\% at GPT-4-level performance compared to the strongest prior router. Our code is available at https://github.com/AIGNLAI/EquiRouter.]]></description>

Single-cell RNA-seq profiles are high-dimensional, sparse, and unordered, causing autoregressive generation to impose an artificial ordering bias and suffer from error accumulation. To address this, we propose scDiVa, a masked discrete diffusion foundation model that aligns generation with the dropout-like corruption process by defining a continuous-time forward masking mechanism in token space. ScDiVa features a bidirectional denoiser that jointly models discrete gene identities and continuous values, utilizing entropy-normalized serialization and a latent anchor token to maximize information efficiency and preserve global cell identity. The model is trained via depth-invariant time sampling and a dual denoising objective to simulate varying sparsity levels while ensuring precise recovery of both identity and magnitude. Pre-trained on 59 million cells, scDiVa achieves strong transfer performance across major benchmarks, including batch integration, cell type annotation, and perturbation response prediction. These results suggest that masked discrete diffusion serves as a biologically coherent and effective alternative to autoregression.]]></description>

Continual learning, especially class-incremental learning (CIL), on the basis of a pre-trained model (PTM) has garnered substantial research interest in recent years. However, how to effectively learn both discriminative and comprehensive feature representations while maintaining stability and plasticity over very long task sequences remains an open problem. We propose CaRE, a scalable {C}ontinual Le{a}rner with efficient Bi-Level {R}outing Mixture-of-{E}xperts (BR-MoE). The core idea of BR-MoE is a bi-level routing mechanism: a router selection stage that dynamically activates relevant task-specific routers, followed by an expert routing phase that dynamically activates and aggregates experts, aiming to inject discriminative and comprehensive representations into every intermediate network layer. On the other hand, we introduce a challenging evaluation protocol for comprehensively assessing CIL methods across very long task sequences spanning hundreds of tasks. Extensive experiments show that CaRE demonstrates leading performance across a variety of datasets and task settings, including commonly used CIL datasets with classical CIL settings (e.g., 5-20 tasks). To the best of our knowledge, CaRE is the first continual learner that scales to very long task sequences (ranging from 100 to over 300 non-overlapping tasks), while outperforming all baselines by a large margin on such task sequences. Code will be publicly released at https://github.com/LMMMEng/CaRE.git.]]></description>

Object detection is pivotal in computer vision, yet its immense computational demands make deployment slow and power-hungry, motivating quantization. However, task-irrelevant morphologies such as background clutter and sensor noise induce redundant activations (or anomalies). These anomalies expand activation ranges and skew activation distributions toward task-irrelevant responses, complicating bit allocation and weakening the preservation of informative features. Without a clear criterion to distinguish anomalies, suppressing them can inadvertently discard useful information. To address this, we present InlierQ, an inlier-centric post-training quantization approach that separates anomalies from informative inliers. InlierQ computes gradient-aware volume saliency scores, classifies each volume as an inlier or anomaly, and fits a posterior distribution over these scores using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. This design suppresses anomalies while preserving informative features. InlierQ is label-free, drop-in, and requires only 64 calibration samples. Experiments on the COCO and nuScenes benchmarks show consistent reductions in quantization error for camera-based (2D and 3D) and LiDAR-based (3D) object detection.]]></description>

Deep Research (DR) agents extend Large Language Models (LLMs) beyond parametric knowledge by autonomously retrieving and synthesizing evidence from large web corpora into long-form reports, enabling a long-horizon agentic paradigm. However, unlike real-time conversational assistants, DR is computationally expensive and time-consuming, creating an autonomy-interaction dilemma: high autonomy on ambiguous user queries often leads to prolonged execution with unsatisfactory outcomes. To address this, we propose IntentRL, a framework that trains proactive agents to clarify latent user intents before starting long-horizon research. To overcome the scarcity of open-ended research data, we introduce a scalable pipeline that expands a few seed samples into high-quality dialogue turns via a shallow-to-deep intent refinement graph. We further adopt a two-stage reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: Stage I applies RL on offline dialogues to efficiently learn general user-interaction behavior, while Stage II uses the trained agent and a user simulator for online rollouts to strengthen adaptation to diverse user feedback. Extensive experiments show that IntentRL significantly improves both intent hit rate and downstream task performance, outperforming the built-in clarify modules of closed-source DR agents and proactive LLM baselines.]]></description>

Explanations are central to human cognition, yet AI systems often produce outputs that are difficult to understand. While symbolic AI offers a transparent foundation for interpretability, raw logical traces often impose a high extraneous cognitive load. We investigate how formal abstractions, specifically removal and clustering, impact human reasoning performance and cognitive effort. Utilizing Answer Set Programming (ASP) as a formal framework, we define a notion of irrelevant details to be abstracted over to obtain simplified explanations. Our cognitive experiments, in which participants classified stimuli across domains with explanations derived from an answer set program, show that clustering details significantly improve participants' understanding, while removal of details significantly reduce cognitive effort, supporting the hypothesis that abstraction enhances human-centered symbolic explanations.]]></description>

Large language models (LLMs) can generate structured artifacts, but using them as dependable optimizers for scientific design requires a mechanism for iterative improvement under black-box evaluation. Here, we cast quantum circuit synthesis as a closed-loop, test-time optimization problem: an LLM proposes edits to a fixed-length gate list, and an external simulator evaluates the resulting state with the Meyer-Wallach (MW) global entanglement measure. We introduce a lightweight test-time learning recipe that can reuse prior high-performing candidates as an explicit memory trace, augments prompts with a score-difference feedback, and applies restart-from-the-best sampling to escape potential plateaus. Across fixed 20-qubit settings, the loop without feedback and restart-from-the-best improves random initial circuits over a range of gate budgets. To lift up this performance and success rate, we use the full learning strategy. For 25-qubit, it mitigates a pronounced performance plateau when naive querying is used. Beyond raw scores, we analyze the structure of synthesized states and find that high MW solutions can correspond to stabilizer or graph-state-like constructions, but full connectivity is not guaranteed due to the metric property and prompt design. These results illustrate both the promise and the pitfalls of memory evaluator-guided LLM optimization for circuit synthesis, highlighting the critical role of prior human-made theoretical theorem to optimally design a custom tool in support of research.]]></description>

Integrating hard constraints into deep learning is essential for safety-critical systems. Yet existing constructive layers that project predictions onto constraint boundaries face a fundamental bottleneck: gradient saturation. By collapsing exterior points onto lower-dimensional surfaces, standard orthogonal projections induce rank-deficient Jacobians, which nullify gradients orthogonal to active constraints and hinder optimization. We introduce Soft-Radial Projection, a differentiable reparameterization layer that circumvents this issue through a radial mapping from Euclidean space into the interior of the feasible set. This construction guarantees strict feasibility while preserving a full-rank Jacobian almost everywhere, thereby preventing the optimization stalls typical of boundary-based methods. We theoretically prove that the architecture retains the universal approximation property and empirically show improved convergence behavior and solution quality over state-of-the-art optimization- and projection-based baselines.]]></description>

Estimating treatment effects in networks is challenging, as each potential outcome depends on the treatments of all other nodes in the network. To overcome this difficulty, existing methods typically impose an exposure mapping that compresses the treatment assignments in the network into a low-dimensional summary. However, if this mapping is misspecified, standard estimators for direct and spillover effects can be severely biased. We propose a novel partial identification framework for causal inference on networks to assess the robustness of treatment effects under misspecifications of the exposure mapping. Specifically, we derive sharp upper and lower bounds on direct and spillover effects under such misspecifications. As such, our framework presents a novel application of causal sensitivity analysis to exposure mappings. We instantiate our framework for three canonical exposure settings widely used in practice: (i) weighted means of the neighborhood treatments, (ii) threshold-based exposure mappings, and (iii) truncated neighborhood interference in the presence of higher-order spillovers. Furthermore, we develop orthogonal estimators for these bounds and prove that the resulting bound estimates are valid, sharp, and efficient. Our experiments show the bounds remain informative and provide reliable conclusions under misspecification of exposure mappings.]]></description>

Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is effective for training large language models on deterministic outcome reasoning tasks. Prior work shows RLVR works with few prompts, but prompt selection is often based only on training-accuracy variance, leading to unstable optimization directions and weaker transfer. We revisit prompt selection from a mechanism-level view and argue that an effective minibatch should provide both (i) a reliable positive anchor and (ii) explicit negative learning signals from rare failures. Based on this principle, we propose \emph{positive--negative pairing}: at each update, we sample a hard-but-solvable $q^{+}$ and an easy-but-brittle prompt $q^{-}$(high success rate but not perfect), characterized by low and high empirical success rates under multiple rollouts. We further introduce Weighted GRPO, which reweights binary outcomes at the pair level and uses group-normalized advantages to amplify rare successes on $q^{+}$ into sharp positive guidance while turning rare failures on $q^{-}$ into strong negative penalties. This bidirectional signal provides informative learning feedback for both successes and failures, improving sample efficiency without suppressing exploration. On Qwen2.5-Math-7B, a single paired minibatch per update consistently outperforms a GRPO baseline that selects two prompts via commonly used variance-based selection heuristics: AIME~2025 Pass@8 improves from 16.8 to 22.2, and AMC23 Pass@64 from 94.0 to 97.0, while remaining competitive with large-scale RLVR trained from a pool of 1209 training prompts. Similar gains are observed on Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct.]]></description>

Score-based diffusion models are a recently developed framework for posterior sampling in Bayesian inverse problems with a state-of-the-art performance for severely ill-posed problems by leveraging a powerful prior distribution learned from empirical data. Despite generating significant interest especially in the machine-learning community, a thorough study of realistic inverse problems in the presence of modelling error and utilization of physical measurement data is still outstanding. In this work, the framework of unconditional representation for the conditional score function (UCoS) is evaluated for linearized difference imaging in diffuse optical tomography (DOT). DOT uses boundary measurements of near-infrared light to estimate the spatial distribution of absorption and scattering parameters in biological tissues. The problem is highly ill-posed and thus sensitive to noise and modelling errors. We introduce a novel regularization approach that prevents overfitting of the score function by constructing a mixed score composed of a learned and a model-based component. Validation of this approach is done using both simulated and experimental measurement data. The experiments demonstrate that a data-driven prior distribution results in posterior samples with low variance, compared to classical model-based estimation, and centred around the ground truth, even in the context of a highly ill-posed problem and in the presence of modelling errors.]]></description>

Multi-subject image generation aims to synthesize images that faithfully preserve the identities of multiple reference subjects while following textual instructions. However, existing methods often suffer from identity inconsistency and limited compositional control, as they rely on diffusion models to implicitly associate text prompts with reference images. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Concept-to-Appearance Guidance (CAG), a framework that provides explicit, structured supervision from high-level concepts to fine-grained appearances. At the conceptual level, we introduce a VAE dropout training strategy that randomly omits reference VAE features, encouraging the model to rely more on robust semantic signals from a Visual Language Model (VLM) and thereby promoting consistent concept-level generation in the absence of complete appearance cues. At the appearance level, we integrate the VLM-derived correspondences into a correspondence-aware masked attention module within the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). This module restricts each text token to attend only to its matched reference regions, ensuring precise attribute binding and reliable multi-subject composition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the multi-subject image generation, substantially improving prompt following and subject consistency.]]></description>

We present HetroD, a dataset and benchmark for developing autonomous driving systems in heterogeneous environments. HetroD targets the critical challenge of navi- gating real-world heterogeneous traffic dominated by vulner- able road users (VRUs), including pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists that interact with vehicles. These mixed agent types exhibit complex behaviors such as hook turns, lane splitting, and informal right-of-way negotiation. Such behaviors pose significant challenges for autonomous vehicles but remain underrepresented in existing datasets focused on structured, lane-disciplined traffic. To bridge the gap, we collect a large- scale drone-based dataset to provide a holistic observation of traffic scenes with centimeter-accurate annotations, HD maps, and traffic signal states. We further develop a modular toolkit for extracting per-agent scenarios to support downstream task development. In total, the dataset comprises over 65.4k high- fidelity agent trajectories, 70% of which are from VRUs. HetroD supports modeling of VRU behaviors in dense, het- erogeneous traffic and provides standardized benchmarks for forecasting, planning, and simulation tasks. Evaluation results reveal that state-of-the-art prediction and planning models struggle with the challenges presented by our dataset: they fail to predict lateral VRU movements, cannot handle unstructured maneuvers, and exhibit limited performance in dense and multi-agent scenarios, highlighting the need for more robust approaches to heterogeneous traffic.

Lifelong learning is critical for embodied agents in open-world environments, where reinforcement learning fine-tuning has emerged as an important paradigm to enable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to master dexterous manipulation through environmental interaction. Thus, Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is a promising pathway for deploying VLA models in lifelong robotic scenarios, yet balancing stability (retaining old skills) and plasticity (learning new ones) remains a formidable challenge for existing methods. We introduce CRL-VLA, a framework for continual post-training of VLA models with rigorous theoretical bounds. We derive a unified performance bound linking the stability-plasticity trade-off to goal-conditioned advantage magnitude, scaled by policy divergence. CRL-VLA resolves this dilemma via asymmetric regulation: constraining advantage magnitudes on prior tasks while enabling controlled growth on new tasks. This is realized through a simple but effective dual-critic architecture with novel Goal-Conditioned Value Formulation (GCVF), where a frozen critic anchors semantic consistency and a trainable estimator drives adaptation. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that CRL-VLA effectively harmonizes these conflicting objectives, outperforming baselines in both anti-forgetting and forward adaptation.]]></description>

Frontier language models have demonstrated strong reasoning and long-horizon tool-use capabilities. However, existing RAG systems fail to leverage these capabilities. They still rely on two paradigms: (1) designing an algorithm that retrieves passages in a single shot and concatenates them into the model's input, or (2) predefining a workflow and prompting the model to execute it step-by-step. Neither paradigm allows the model to participate in retrieval decisions, preventing efficient scaling with model improvements. In this paper, we introduce A-RAG, an Agentic RAG framework that exposes hierarchical retrieval interfaces directly to the model. A-RAG provides three retrieval tools: keyword search, semantic search, and chunk read, enabling the agent to adaptively search and retrieve information across multiple granularities. Experiments on multiple open-domain QA benchmarks show that A-RAG consistently outperforms existing approaches with comparable or lower retrieved tokens, demonstrating that A-RAG effectively leverages model capabilities and dynamically adapts to different RAG tasks. We further systematically study how A-RAG scales with model size and test-time compute. We will release our code and evaluation suite to facilitate future research. Code and evaluation suite are available at https://github.com/Ayanami0730/arag.]]></description>

We introduce ontology-to-tools compilation as a proof-of-principle mechanism for coupling large language models (LLMs) with formal domain knowledge. Within The World Avatar (TWA), ontological specifications are compiled into executable tool interfaces that LLM-based agents must use to create and modify knowledge graph instances, enforcing semantic constraints during generation rather than through post-hoc validation. Extending TWA's semantic agent composition framework, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and associated agents are integral components of the knowledge graph ecosystem, enabling structured interaction between generative models, symbolic constraints, and external resources. An agent-based workflow translates ontologies into ontology-aware tools and iteratively applies them to extract, validate, and repair structured knowledge from unstructured scientific text. Using metal-organic polyhedra synthesis literature as an illustrative case, we show how executable ontological semantics can guide LLM behaviour and reduce manual schema and prompt engineering, establishing a general paradigm for embedding formal knowledge into generative systems.]]></description>

The Non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism is a particularly powerful method to simulate the quantum transport properties of nanoscale devices such as transistors, photo-diodes, or memory cells, in the ballistic limit of transport or in the presence of various scattering sources such as electronphonon, electron-photon, or even electron-electron interactions. The inclusion of all these mechanisms has been first demonstrated in small systems, composed of a few atoms, before being scaled up to larger structures made of thousands of atoms. Also, the accuracy of the models has kept improving, from empirical to fully ab-initio ones, e.g., density functional theory (DFT). This paper summarizes key (algorithmic) achievements that have allowed us to bring DFT+NEGF simulations closer to the dimensions and functionality of realistic systems. The possibility of leveraging graph neural networks and machine learning to speed up ab-initio device simulations is discussed as well.]]></description>

To handle ambiguous and open-ended requests, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to interact with users to surface intents they have not yet expressed (e.g., ask clarification questions). However, users are often ambiguous because they have not yet formed their intents: they must observe and explore outcomes to discover what they want. Simply asking "what kind of tone do you want?" fails when users themselves do not know. We introduce DiscoverLLM, a novel and generalizable framework that trains LLMs to help users form and discover their intents. Central to our approach is a novel user simulator that models cognitive state with a hierarchy of intents that progressively concretize as the model surfaces relevant options -- where the degree of concretization serves as a reward signal that models can be trained to optimize. Resulting models learn to collaborate with users by adaptively diverging (i.e., explore options) when intents are unclear, and converging (i.e., refine and implement) when intents concretize. Across proposed interactive benchmarks in creative writing, technical writing, and SVG drawing, DiscoverLLM achieves over 10% higher task performance while reducing conversation length by up to 40%. In a user study with 75 human participants, DiscoverLLM improved conversation satisfaction and efficiency compared to baselines.]]></description>

Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on flow-based models is crucial for preference alignment. However, they often introduce visual hallucinations like over-optimized details and semantic misalignment. This work preliminarily explores why visual hallucinations arise and how to reduce them. We first investigate RFT methods from a unified perspective, and reveal the core problems stemming from two aspects, exploration and exploitation: (1) limited exploration during stochastic differential equation (SDE) rollouts, leading to an over-emphasis on local details at the expense of global semantics, and (2) trajectory imitation process inherent in policy gradient methods, distorting the model's foundational vector field and its cross-step consistency. Building on this, we propose ConsistentRFT, a general framework to mitigate these hallucinations. Specifically, we design a Dynamic Granularity Rollout (DGR) mechanism to balance exploration between global semantics and local details by dynamically scheduling different noise sources. We then introduce a Consistent Policy Gradient Optimization (CPGO) that preserves the model's consistency by aligning the current policy with a more stable prior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsistentRFT significantly mitigates visual hallucinations, achieving average reductions of 49\% for low-level and 38\% for high-level perceptual hallucinations. Furthermore, ConsistentRFT outperforms other RFT methods on out-of-domain metrics, showing an improvement of 5.1\% (v.s. the baseline's decrease of -0.4\%) over FLUX1.dev.

The proliferation of generative AI poses challenges for information integrity assurance, requiring systems that connect model governance with end-user verification. We present Origin Lens, a privacy-first mobile framework that targets visual disinformation through a layered verification architecture. Unlike server-side detection systems, Origin Lens performs cryptographic image provenance verification and AI detection locally on the device via a Rust/Flutter hybrid architecture. Our system integrates multiple signals - including cryptographic provenance, generative model fingerprints, and optional retrieval-augmented verification - to provide users with graded confidence indicators at the point of consumption. We discuss the framework's alignment with regulatory requirements (EU AI Act, DSA) and its role in verification infrastructure that complements platform-level mechanisms.]]></description>

Emotional expression in human speech is nuanced and compositional, often involving multiple, sometimes conflicting, affective cues that may diverge from linguistic content. In contrast, most expressive text-to-speech systems enforce a single utterance-level emotion, collapsing affective diversity and suppressing mixed or text-emotion-misaligned expression. While activation steering via latent direction vectors offers a promising solution, it remains unclear whether emotion representations are linearly steerable in TTS, where steering should be applied within hybrid TTS architectures, and how such complex emotion behaviors should be evaluated. This paper presents the first systematic analysis of activation steering for emotional control in hybrid TTS models, introducing a quantitative, controllable steering framework, and multi-rater evaluation protocols that enable composable mixed-emotion synthesis and reliable text-emotion mismatch synthesis. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that emotional prosody and expressive variability are primarily synthesized by the TTS language module instead of the flow-matching module, and also provide a lightweight steering approach for generating natural, human-like emotional speech.]]></description>

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled software engineering agents to tackle complex code modification tasks. Most existing approaches rely on execution feedback from containerized environments, which require dependency-complete setup and physical execution of programs and tests. While effective, this paradigm is resource-intensive and difficult to maintain, substantially complicating agent training and limiting scalability. We propose SWE-World, a Docker-free framework that replaces physical execution environments with a learned surrogate for training and evaluating software engineering agents. SWE-World leverages LLM-based models trained on real agent-environment interaction data to predict intermediate execution outcomes and final test feedback, enabling agents to learn without interacting with physical containerized environments. This design preserves the standard agent-environment interaction loop while eliminating the need for costly environment construction and maintenance during agent optimization and evaluation. Furthermore, because SWE-World can simulate the final evaluation outcomes of candidate trajectories without real submission, it enables selecting the best solution among multiple test-time attempts, thereby facilitating effective test-time scaling (TTS) in software engineering tasks. Experiments on SWE-bench Verified demonstrate that SWE-World raises Qwen2.5-Coder-32B from 6.2\% to 52.0\% via Docker-free SFT, 55.0\% with Docker-free RL, and 68.2\% with further TTS.

While LLMs exhibit remarkable fluency, their utility is often compromised by factual hallucinations and a lack of traceable provenance. Existing resources for grounding mitigate this but typically enforce a dichotomy: they offer either structured knowledge without textual context (e.g., knowledge bases) or grounded text with limited scale and linguistic coverage. To bridge this gap, we introduce FactNet, a massive, open-source resource designed to unify 1.7 billion atomic assertions with 3.01 billion auditable evidence pointers derived exclusively from 316 Wikipedia editions. Unlike recent synthetic approaches, FactNet employs a strictly deterministic construction pipeline, ensuring that every evidence unit is recoverable with byte-level precision. Extensive auditing confirms a high grounding precision of 92.1%, even in long-tail languages. Furthermore, we establish FactNet-Bench, a comprehensive evaluation suite for Knowledge Graph Completion, Question Answering, and Fact Checking. FactNet provides the community with a foundational, reproducible resource for training and evaluating trustworthy, verifiable multilingual systems.]]></description>

The existence of adversarial examples is relatively understood for random fully connected neural networks, but much less so for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The recent work [Daniely, 2025] establishes that adversarial examples can be found in CNNs, in some non-optimal distance from the input. We extend over this work and prove that adversarial examples in random CNNs with input dimension $d$ can be found already in $\ell_2$-distance of order $\lVert x \rVert /\sqrt{d}$ from the input $x$, which is essentially the nearest possible. We also show that such adversarial small perturbations can be found using a single step of gradient descent. To derive our results we use Fourier decomposition to efficiently bound the singular values of a random linear convolutional operator, which is the main ingredient of a CNN layer. This bound might be of independent interest.]]></description>

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced vision-language understanding. However, even state-of-the-art models struggle with geometric reasoning, revealing a critical bottleneck: the extreme scarcity of high-quality image-text pairs. Human annotation is prohibitively expensive, while automated methods fail to ensure fidelity and training effectiveness. Existing approaches either passively adapt to available images or employ inefficient random exploration with filtering, decoupling generation from learning needs. We propose Socratic-Geo, a fully autonomous framework that dynamically couples data synthesis with model learning through multi-agent interaction. The Teacher agent generates parameterized Python scripts with reflective feedback (Reflect for solvability, RePI for visual validity), ensuring image-text pair purity. The Solver agent optimizes reasoning through preference learning, with failure paths guiding Teacher's targeted augmentation. Independently, the Generator learns image generation capabilities on accumulated "image-code-instruction" triplets, distilling programmatic drawing intelligence into visual generation. Starting from only 108 seed problems, Socratic-Solver achieves 49.11 on six benchmarks using one-quarter of baseline data, surpassing strong baselines by 2.43 points. Socratic-Generator achieves 42.4% on GenExam, establishing new state-of-the-art for open-source models, surpassing Seedream-4.0 (39.8%) and approaching Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image (43.1%).]]></description>

As large language model agents tackle increasingly complex long-horizon tasks, effective post-training becomes critical. Prior work faces fundamental challenges: outcome-only rewards fail to precisely attribute credit to intermediate steps, estimated step-level rewards introduce systematic noise, and Monte Carlo sampling approaches for step reward estimation incur prohibitive computational cost. Inspired by findings that only a small fraction of high-entropy tokens drive effective RL for reasoning, we propose Critical Step Optimization (CSO), which focuses preference learning on verified critical steps, decision points where alternate actions demonstrably flip task outcomes from failure to success. Crucially, our method starts from failed policy trajectories rather than expert demonstrations, directly targeting the policy model's weaknesses. We use a process reward model (PRM) to identify candidate critical steps, leverage expert models to propose high-quality alternatives, then continue execution from these alternatives using the policy model itself until task completion. Only alternatives that the policy successfully executes to correct outcomes are verified and used as DPO training data, ensuring both quality and policy reachability. This yields fine-grained, verifiable supervision at critical decisions while avoiding trajectory-level coarseness and step-level noise. Experiments on GAIA-Text-103 and XBench-DeepSearch show that CSO achieves 37% and 26% relative improvement over the SFT baseline and substantially outperforms other post-training methods, while requiring supervision at only 16% of trajectory steps. This demonstrates the effectiveness of selective verification-based learning for agent post-training.]]></description>

In this technical report, we present SWE-Master, an open-source and fully reproducible post-training framework for building effective software engineering agents. SWE-Master systematically explores the complete agent development pipeline, including teacher-trajectory synthesis and data curation, long-horizon SFT, RL with real execution feedback, and inference framework design. Starting from an open-source base model with limited initial SWE capability, SWE-Master demonstrates how systematical optimization method can elicit strong long-horizon SWE task solving abilities. We evaluate SWE-Master on SWE-bench Verified, a standard benchmark for realistic software engineering tasks. Under identical experimental settings, our approach achieves a resolve rate of 61.4\% with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, substantially outperforming existing open-source baselines. By further incorporating test-time scaling~(TTS) with LLM-based environment feedback, SWE-Master reaches 70.8\% at TTS@8, demonstrating a strong performance potential. SWE-Master provides a practical and transparent foundation for advancing reproducible research on software engineering agents.

Recent advances in large-scale diffusion models have intensified concerns about their potential misuse, particularly in generating realistic yet harmful or socially disruptive content. This challenge has spurred growing interest in effective machine unlearning, the process of selectively removing specific knowledge or concepts from a model without compromising its overall generative capabilities. Among various approaches, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as an effective and efficient method for fine-tuning models toward targeted unlearning. However, LoRA-based methods often exhibit limited adaptability to concept semantics and struggle to balance removing closely related concepts with maintaining generalization across broader meanings. Moreover, these methods face scalability challenges when multiple concepts must be erased simultaneously. To address these limitations, we introduce UnHype, a framework that incorporates hypernetworks into single- and multi-concept LoRA training. The proposed architecture can be directly plugged into Stable Diffusion as well as modern flow-based text-to-image models, where it demonstrates stable training behavior and effective concept control. During inference, the hypernetwork dynamically generates adaptive LoRA weights based on the CLIP embedding, enabling more context-aware, scalable unlearning. We evaluate UnHype across several challenging tasks, including object erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content removal, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.

Quantum generative models offer a novel approach to exploring high-dimensional Hilbert spaces but face significant challenges in scalability and expressibility when applied to multi-modal distributions. In this study, we explore a Hybrid Quantum-Classical U-Net architecture integrated with Adaptive Non-Local Observables (ANO) as a potential solution to these hurdles. By compressing classical data into a dense quantum latent space and utilizing trainable observables, our model aims to extract non-local features that complement classical processing. We also investigate the role of Skip Connections in preserving semantic information during the reverse diffusion process. Experimental results on the full MNIST dataset (digits 0-9) demonstrate that the proposed architecture is capable of generating structurally coherent and recognizable images for all digit classes. While hardware constraints still impose limitations on resolution, our findings suggest that hybrid architectures with adaptive measurements provide a feasible pathway for mitigating mode collapse and enhancing generative capabilities in the NISQ era.]]></description>

In three-way conflict analysis, preference-based conflict situations characterize agents' attitudes towards issues by formally modeling their preferences over pairs of issues. However, existing preference-based conflict models rely exclusively on three qualitative relations, namely, preference, converse, and indifference, to describe agents' attitudes towards issue pairs, which significantly limits their capacity in capturing the essence of conflict. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the concept of an intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict situation that captures agents' attitudes towards issue pairs with finer granularity than that afforded by classical preference-based models. Afterwards, we develop intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict measures within this framework, and construct three-way conflict analysis models for trisecting the set of agent pairs, the agent set, and the issue set. Additionally, relative loss functions built on the proposed conflict functions are employed to calculate thresholds for three-way conflict analysis. Finally, we present adjustment mechanism-based feasible strategies that simultaneously account for both adjustment magnitudes and conflict degrees, together with an algorithm for constructing such feasible strategies, and provide an illustrative example to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed model.]]></description>

Vision language models (VLMs) extend the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to cross-modal settings, yet remain highly vulnerable to multimodal jailbreak attacks. Existing defenses predominantly rely on safety fine-tuning or aggressive token manipulations, incurring substantial training costs or significantly degrading utility. Recent research shows that LLMs inherently recognize unsafe content in text, and the incorporation of visual inputs in VLMs frequently dilutes risk-related signals. Motivated by this, we propose Risk Awareness Injection (RAI), a lightweight and training-free framework for safety calibration that restores LLM-like risk recognition by amplifying unsafe signals in VLMs. Specifically, RAI constructs an Unsafe Prototype Subspace from language embeddings and performs targeted modulation on selected high-risk visual tokens, explicitly activating safety-critical signals within the cross-modal feature space. This modulation restores the model's LLM-like ability to detect unsafe content from visual inputs, while preserving the semantic integrity of original tokens for cross-modal reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple jailbreak and utility benchmarks demonstrate that RAI substantially reduces attack success rate without compromising task performance.]]></description>

Code summaries are essential for helping developers understand code functionality and reducing maintenance and collaboration costs. Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved automatic code summarization, the practical usefulness of generated summaries in industrial settings remains insufficiently explored. In collaboration with documentation experts from the industrial HarmonyOS project, we conducted a questionnaire study showing that over 57.4% of code summaries produced by state-of-the-art approaches were rejected due to violations of developers' expectations for industrial documentation. Beyond semantic similarity to reference summaries, developers emphasize additional requirements, including the use of appropriate domain terminology, explicit function categorization, and the avoidance of redundant implementation details.
  To address these expectations, we propose ExpSum, an expectation-aware code summarization approach that integrates function metadata abstraction, informative metadata filtering, context-aware domain knowledge retrieval, and constraint-driven prompting to guide LLMs in generating structured, expectation-aligned summaries. We evaluate ExpSum on the HarmonyOS project and widely used code summarization benchmarks. Experimental results show that ExpSum consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving improvements of up to 26.71% in BLEU-4 and 20.10% in ROUGE-L on HarmonyOS. Furthermore, LLM-based evaluations indicate that ExpSum-generated summaries better align with developer expectations across other projects, demonstrating its effectiveness for industrial code documentation.]]></description>

Proprietary large language models (LLMs) embody substantial economic value and are generally exposed only as black-box APIs, yet adversaries can still exploit their outputs to extract knowledge via distillation. Existing defenses focus exclusively on text-based distillation, leaving the important logit-based distillation largely unexplored. In this work, we analyze this problem and present an effective solution from an information-theoretic perspective. We characterize distillation-relevant information in teacher outputs using the conditional mutual information (CMI) between teacher logits and input queries conditioned on ground-truth labels. This quantity captures contextual information beneficial for model extraction, motivating us to defend distillation via CMI minimization. Guided by our theoretical analysis, we propose learning a transformation matrix that purifies the original outputs to enhance distillation resistance. We further derive a CMI-inspired anti-distillation objective to optimize this transformation, which effectively removes distillation-relevant information while preserving output utility. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and strong distillation algorithms demonstrate that the proposed method significantly degrades distillation performance while preserving task accuracy, effectively protecting models' intellectual property.]]></description>

While deep learning has revolutionized financial forecasting through sophisticated architectures, the design of the supervision signal itself is rarely scrutinized. We challenge the canonical assumption that training labels must strictly mirror inference targets, uncovering the Label Horizon Paradox: the optimal supervision signal often deviates from the prediction goal, shifting across intermediate horizons governed by market dynamics. We theoretically ground this phenomenon in a dynamic signal-noise trade-off, demonstrating that generalization hinges on the competition between marginal signal realization and noise accumulation. To operationalize this insight, we propose a bi-level optimization framework that autonomously identifies the optimal proxy label within a single training run. Extensive experiments on large-scale financial datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over conventional baselines, thereby opening new avenues for label-centric research in financial forecasting.]]></description>

Deep neural networks (DNNs) often produce overconfident out-of-distribution predictions, motivating Bayesian uncertainty quantification. The Linearized Laplace Approximation (LLA) achieves this by linearizing the DNN and applying Laplace inference to the resulting model. Importantly, the linear model is also used for prediction. We argue this linearization in the posterior may degrade fidelity to the true Laplace approximation. To alleviate this problem, without increasing significantly the computational cost, we propose the Quadratic Laplace Approximation (QLA). QLA approximates each second order factor in the approximate Laplace log-posterior using a rank-one factor obtained via efficient power iterations. QLA is expected to yield a posterior precision closer to that of the full Laplace without forming the full Hessian, which is typically intractable. For prediction, QLA also uses the linearized model. Empirically, QLA yields modest yet consistent uncertainty estimation improvements over LLA on five regression datasets.]]></description>
