  "daily_summary": "Today's top-scoring papers tackle critical challenges in AI research, from advancing vision-language models like LightOnOCR, which achieves state-of-the-art OCR performance, to addressing fundamental limitations in differential privacy guarantees as seen in Fundamental Limitations of Favorable Privacy-Utility Guarantees for DP-SGD. Papers such as Agentic Reasoning for Large Language Models and Aligning Agentic World Models via Knowledgeable Experience Learning also push the boundaries of large language models, exploring their potential for agentic reasoning and world model alignment. Furthermore, works like CLARE and Spurious Rewards Paradox shed light on key issues in continual learning and reinforcement learning, underscoring the need for more robust and generalizable models.",
