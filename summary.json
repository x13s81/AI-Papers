  "daily_summary": "Today's top-scoring papers tackle critical challenges in AI research, including mitigating copyright risks and promoting out-of-domain generalization in language models, as seen in \"Anchored Decoding: Provably Reducing Copyright Risk for Any Language Model\" and \"Fundamental Reasoning Paradigms Induce Out-of-Domain Generalization in Language Models\". Meanwhile, papers like \"CauScale: Neural Causal Discovery at Scale\" and \"Reasoning-Augmented Representations for Multimodal Retrieval\" push the boundaries of causal discovery and multimodal understanding. These advancements, along with innovations in reinforcement learning and embodied AI, such as \"SkillRL: Evolving Agents via Recursive Skill-Augmented Reinforcement Learning\" and \"RLinf-USER: A Unified and Extensible System for Real-World Online Policy Learning in Embodied AI\", have significant implications for the development of more robust, generalizable, and aligned AI systems.",
