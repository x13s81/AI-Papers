The intersection of AI and other fields is also evident, as seen in DICE, which demonstrates the potential of diffusion large language models in generating CUDA kernels, and scPilot, which applies large language model reasoning to automated single-cell analysis. Furthermore, papers like Qute and ABot-M0 highlight the growing interest in quantum-native databases and robotic manipulation with action manifold learning, showcasing the diverse and innovative applications of AI research.",
