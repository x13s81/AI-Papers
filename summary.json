  "daily_summary": "Today's top-scoring papers offer significant advancements in AI research, with a notable emphasis on causal discovery, multimodal understanding, and efficient modeling. Notably, \"Large Causal Models for Temporal Causal Discovery\" and \"Implicit Intelligence -- Evaluating Agents on What Users Don't Say\" push the boundaries of our understanding of complex systems and human-AI interaction, while papers like \"DODO: Discrete OCR Diffusion Models\" and \"Nacrith: Neural Lossless Compression via Ensemble Context Modeling and High-Precision CDF Coding\" showcase innovative approaches to discrete data modeling and compression. Meanwhile, works such as \"SkillOrchestra: Learning to Route Agents via Skill Transfer\" and \"VidEoMT: Your ViT is Secretly Also a Video Segmentation Model\" demonstrate the potential for skill transfer and multimodal applications in areas like computer vision and robotics.",
