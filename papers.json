      "abstract": "The advancement of artificial intelligence toward agentic science is currently bottlenecked by the challenge of ultra-long-horizon autonomy, the ability to sustain strategic coherence and iterative correction over experimental cycles spanning days or weeks. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated prowess in short-horizon reasoning, they are easily overwhelmed by execution details in the high-dimensional, delayed-feedback environments of real-world research, failing to consolidate sparse feedback into coherent long-term guidance. Here, we present ML-Master 2.0, an autonomous agent that masters ultra-long-horizon machine learning engineering (MLE) which is a representative microcosm of scientific discovery. By reframing context management as a process of cognitive accumulation, our approach introduces Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC), a multi-tiered architecture inspired by computer systems that enables the structural differentiation of experience over time. By dynamically distilling transient execution traces into stable knowledge and cross-task wisdom, HCC allows agents to decouple immediate execution from long-term experimental strategy, effectively overcoming the scaling limits of static context windows. In evaluations on OpenAI's MLE-Bench under 24-hour budgets, ML-Master 2.0 achieves a state-of-the-art medal rate of 56.44%. Our findings demonstrate that ultra-long-horizon autonomy provides a scalable blueprint for AI capable of autonomous exploration beyond human-precedent complexities.",

Existing LLM-based agents rely on static, pre-defined tool libraries, a paradigm that fundamentally fails in scientific domains where tools are sparse, heterogeneous, and intrinsically incomplete. In this paper, we propose Test-Time Tool Evolution (TTE), a new paradigm that enables agents to synthesize, verify, and evolve executable tools during inference. By transforming tools from fixed resources into problem-driven artifacts, TTE overcomes the rigidity and long-tail limitations of static tool libraries. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce SciEvo, a benchmark comprising 1,590 scientific reasoning tasks supported by 925 automatically evolved tools. Extensive experiments show that TTE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and tool efficiency, while enabling effective cross-domain adaptation of computational tools.

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) based autonomous agents demonstrate multifaceted capabilities to contribute substantially to economic production. However, existing benchmarks remain focused on single agentic capability, failing to capture long-horizon real-world scenarios. Moreover, the reliance on human-in-the-loop feedback for realistic tasks creates a scalability bottleneck, hindering automated rollout collection and evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgencyBench, a comprehensive benchmark derived from daily AI usage, evaluating 6 core agentic capabilities across 32 real-world scenarios, comprising 138 tasks with specific queries, deliverables, and rubrics. These scenarios require an average of 90 tool calls, 1 million tokens, and hours of execution time to resolve. To enable automated evaluation, we employ a user simulation agent to provide iterative feedback, and a Docker sandbox to conduct visual and functional rubric-based assessment. Experiments reveal that closed-source models significantly outperform open-source models (48.4% vs 32.1%). Further analysis reveals significant disparities across models in resource efficiency, feedback-driven self-correction, and specific tool-use preferences. Finally, we investigate the impact of agentic scaffolds, observing that proprietary models demonstrate superior performance within their native ecosystems (e.g., Claude-4.5-Opus via Claude-Agent-SDK), while open-source models exhibit distinct performance peaks, suggesting potential optimization for specific execution frameworks. AgencyBench serves as a critical testbed for next-generation agents, highlighting the necessity of co-optimizing model architecture with agentic frameworks. We believe this work sheds light on the future direction of autonomous agents, and we release the full benchmark and evaluation toolkit at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/AgencyBench.",

We allow changing color, texture, material, and even the shape of an object, while preserving its perceived identity and scene context. Existing approaches either rely on unsupervised priors that often fail to preserve identity or use overly restrictive supervision that prevents meaningful intrinsic variations. Our method relies on: (i) a relaxed training objective that allows the model to change both intrinsic and extrinsic attributes conditioned on an identity reference image, a textual prompt describing the target intrinsic attributes, and a background image and object mask defining the extrinsic context. At inference, we restrict extrinsic changes by reusing the original background and object mask, thereby ensuring that only the desired intrinsic attributes are altered; (ii) Visual Named Entities (VNEs) - fine-grained visual identity categories (e.g., ''Porsche 911 Carrera'') that group objects sharing identity-defining features while allowing variation in intrinsic attributes. We use a vision-language model to automatically extract VNE labels and intrinsic attribute descriptions from a large public image dataset, enabling scalable, identity-preserving supervision. Alterbute outperforms existing methods on identity-preserving object intrinsic attribute editing.",

To address this issue, we propose Factuality-Preserving Personalized Steering (FPPS), a lightweight inference-time approach that mitigates personalization-induced factual distortions while preserving personalized behavior. We further introduce PFQABench, the first benchmark designed to jointly evaluate factual and personalized question answering under personalization.

While point maps assume static scenes, Dynamic Point Maps (DPMs) extend this concept to dynamic 3D content by additionally representing scene motion. However, existing DPMs are limited to image pairs and, like DUSt3R, require post processing via optimization when more than two views are involved. We argue that DPMs are more useful when applied to videos and introduce V-DPM to demonstrate this. First, we show how to formulate DPMs for video input in a way that maximizes representational power, facilitates neural prediction, and enables reuse of pretrained models. Second, we implement these ideas on top of VGGT, a recent and powerful 3D reconstructor. Although VGGT was trained on static scenes, we show that a modest amount of synthetic data is sufficient to adapt it into an effective V-DPM predictor. Our approach achieves state of the art performance in 3D and 4D reconstruction for dynamic scenes. In particular, unlike recent dynamic extensions of VGGT such as P3, DPMs recover not only dynamic depth but also the full 3D motion of every point in the scene.",

Existing pipelines rely on ground-truth skeletons and skinning weights for motion generation and treat auto-rigging as an independent process, undermining scalability and interpretability. We present RigMo, a unified generative framework that jointly learns rig and motion directly from raw mesh sequences, without any human-provided rig annotations. RigMo encodes per-vertex deformations into two compact latent spaces: a rig latent that decodes into explicit Gaussian bones and skinning weights, and a motion latent that produces time-varying SE(3) transformations. Together, these outputs define an animatable mesh with explicit structure and coherent motion, enabling feed-forward rig and motion inference for deformable objects. Beyond unified rig-motion discovery, we introduce a Motion-DiT model operating in RigMo's latent space and demonstrate that these structure-aware latents can naturally support downstream motion generation tasks. Experiments on DeformingThings4D, Objaverse-XL, and TrueBones demonstrate that RigMo learns smooth, interpretable, and physically plausible rigs, while achieving superior reconstruction and category-level generalization compared to existing auto-rigging and deformation baselines.

We localize a Functional Anchor in the middle layers (L18-20) that triggers the retrieval of memorized solutions, followed by Structural Adapters in later layers (L21+) that transform representations to accommodate the shortcut signal. Finally, we demonstrate that scaling specific MLP keys within this circuit allows for bidirectional causal steering-artificially amplifying or suppressing contamination-driven performance.

We propose several new probe architecture that handle this long-context distribution shift.\n  We evaluate these probes in the cyber-offensive domain, testing their robustness against various production-relevant shifts, including multi-turn conversations, static jailbreaks, and adaptive red teaming. Our results demonstrate that while multimax addresses context length, a combination of architecture choice and training on diverse distributions is required for broad generalization. Additionally, we show that pairing probes with prompted classifiers achieves optimal accuracy at a low cost due to the computational efficiency of probes.\n  These findings have informed the successful deployment of misuse mitigation probes in user-facing instances of Gemini, Google's frontier language model. Finally, we find early positive results using AlphaEvolve to automate improvements in both probe architecture search and adaptive red teaming, showing that automating some AI safety research is already possible.",

      "abstract": "Output diversity is crucial for Large Language Models as it underpins pluralism and creativity. In this work, we reveal that controlling the language used during model thinking-the language of thought-provides a novel and structural source of output diversity. Our preliminary study shows that different thinking languages occupy distinct regions in a model's thinking space. Based on this observation, we study two repeated sampling strategies under multilingual thinking-Single-Language Sampling and Mixed-Language Sampling-and conduct diversity evaluation on outputs that are controlled to be in English, regardless of the thinking language used. Across extensive experiments, we demonstrate that switching the thinking language from English to non-English languages consistently increases output diversity, with a clear and consistent positive correlation such that languages farther from English in the thinking space yield larger gains. We further show that aggregating samples across multiple thinking languages yields additional improvements through compositional effects, and that scaling sampling with linguistic heterogeneity expands the model's diversity ceiling. Finally, we show that these findings translate into practical benefits in pluralistic alignment scenarios, leading to broader coverage of cultural knowledge and value orientations in LLM outputs.

      "abstract": "Instruction-based image editing is among the fastest developing areas in generative AI. Over the past year, the field has reached a new level, with dozens of open-source models released alongside highly capable commercial systems. However, only a limited number of open-source approaches currently achieve real-world quality. In addition, diffusion backbones, the dominant choice for these pipelines, are often large and computationally expensive for many deployments and research settings, with widely used variants typically containing 6B to 20B parameters. This paper presents a compact, high-throughput instruction-based image editing pipeline that uses a modern 2B-parameter Qwen3-VL model to guide the editing process and the 1.6B-parameter diffusion model Sana1.5 for image generation. Our design decisions across architecture, data processing, training configuration, and evaluation target low-cost inference and strict source consistency while maintaining high quality across the major edit categories feasible at this scale. Evaluated on the ImgEdit and GEdit benchmarks, the proposed method matches or exceeds the performance of substantially heavier baselines, including models with several times as many parameters and higher inference cost, and is particularly strong on edits that require preserving the input image, such as an attribute adjustment, object removal, background edits, and targeted replacement. The model fits within 24 GB of GPU memory and generates edited images at up to 2K resolution in approximately 4 seconds on an NVIDIA H100 in BF16, without additional inference optimizations or distillation.",

Although large language models (LLMs) are expressive, they struggle with precise multi-objective control and numeric reasoning without external structure and feedback. We introduce M olGen, a fragment-level, retrieval-augmented, two-stage framework for molecule generation under multi-property constraints. Stage I : Prototype generation: a multi-agent reasoner performs retrieval-anchored, fragment-level edits to produce a candidate near the feasible region. Stage II : RL-based fine-grained optimization: a fragment-level optimizer trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) applies one- or multi-hop refinements to explicitly minimize the property errors toward our target while regulating edit complexity and deviation from the prototype. A large, automatically curated dataset with reasoning chains of fragment edits and measured property deltas underpins both stages, enabling deterministic, reproducible supervision and controllable multi-hop reasoning. Unlike prior work, our framework better reasons about molecules by leveraging fragments and supports controllable refinement toward numeric targets. Experiments on generation under two sets of property constraints (QED, LogP, Molecular Weight and HOMO, LUMO) show consistent gains in validity and precise satisfaction of multi-property targets, outperforming strong LLMs and graph-based algorithms.",

However, traditional SFT often ignores the one-to-many nature of language by forcing alignment with a single reference answer, leading to the model overfitting to non-core expressions. Although our empirical analysis suggests that introducing multiple reference answers can mitigate this issue, the prohibitive data and computational costs necessitate a strategic shift: prioritizing the mitigation of single-reference overfitting over the costly pursuit of answer diversity. To achieve this, we reveal the intrinsic connection between token probability and semantic importance: high-probability tokens carry the core logical framework, while low-probability tokens are mostly replaceable expressions. Based on this insight, we propose ProFit, which selectively masks low-probability tokens to prevent surface-level overfitting. Extensive experiments confirm that ProFit consistently outperforms traditional SFT baselines on general reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.",

This gap highlights a critical limitation in rendering rigid body motion, a core tenet of classical mechanics. While computer graphics and physics-based simulators can easily model such collisions using Newton formulas, modern pretrain-finetune paradigms discard the concept of object rigidity during pixel-level global denoising. Even perfectly correct mathematical constraints are treated as suboptimal solutions (i.e., conditions) during model optimization in post-training, fundamentally limiting the physical realism of generated videos. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce, for the first time, a physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm for video generation models that enforces physical collision rules directly in high-dimensional spaces, ensuring the physics knowledge is strictly applied rather than treated as conditions. Subsequently, we extend this paradigm to a unified framework, termed Mimicry-Discovery Cycle (MDcycle), which allows substantial fine-tuning while fully preserving the model's ability to leverage physics-grounded feedback. To validate our approach, we construct new benchmark PhysRVGBench and perform extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to thoroughly assess its effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Promptable segmentation foundation models such as SAM3 have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities through interactive and concept-based prompting. However, their direct applicability to medical image segmentation remains limited by severe domain shifts, the absence of privileged spatial prompts, and the need to reason over complex anatomical and volumetric structures. Here we present Medical SAM3, a foundation model for universal prompt-driven medical image segmentation, obtained by fully fine-tuning SAM3 on large-scale, heterogeneous 2D and 3D medical imaging datasets with paired segmentation masks and text prompts. Through a systematic analysis of vanilla SAM3, we observe that its performance degrades substantially on medical data, with its apparent competitiveness largely relying on strong geometric priors such as ground-truth-derived bounding boxes. These findings motivate full model adaptation beyond prompt engineering alone. By fine-tuning SAM3's model parameters on 33 datasets spanning 10 medical imaging modalities, Medical SAM3 acquires robust domain-specific representations while preserving prompt-driven flexibility. Extensive experiments across organs, imaging modalities, and dimensionalities demonstrate consistent and significant performance gains, particularly in challenging scenarios characterized by semantic ambiguity, complex morphology, and long-range 3D context. Our results establish Medical SAM3 as a universal, text-guided segmentation foundation model for medical imaging and highlight the importance of holistic model adaptation for achieving robust prompt-driven segmentation under severe domain shift.

The only known robust defense is architectural isolation that strictly separates trusted task planning from untrusted environment observations. However, applying this design to Computer Use Agents (CUAs) -- systems that automate tasks by viewing screens and executing actions -- presents a fundamental challenge: current agents require continuous observation of UI state to determine each action, conflicting with the isolation required for security. We resolve this tension by demonstrating that UI workflows, while dynamic, are structurally predictable. We introduce Single-Shot Planning for CUAs, where a trusted planner generates a complete execution graph with conditional branches before any observation of potentially malicious content, providing provable control flow integrity guarantees against arbitrary instruction injections. Although this architectural isolation successfully prevents instruction injections, we show that additional measures are needed to prevent Branch Steering attacks, which manipulate UI elements to trigger unintended valid paths within the plan. We evaluate our design on OSWorld, and retain up to 57% of the performance of frontier models while improving performance for smaller open-source models by up to 19%, demonstrating that rigorous security and utility can coexist in CUAs.",

      "abstract": "We present WildRayZer, a self-supervised framework for novel view synthesis (NVS) in dynamic environments where both the camera and objects move. Dynamic content breaks the multi-view consistency that static NVS models rely on, leading to ghosting, hallucinated geometry, and unstable pose estimation. WildRayZer addresses this by performing an analysis-by-synthesis test: a camera-only static renderer explains rigid structure, and its residuals reveal transient regions. From these residuals, we construct pseudo motion masks, distill a motion estimator, and use it to mask input tokens and gate loss gradients so supervision focuses on cross-view background completion. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we curate Dynamic RealEstate10K (D-RE10K), a real-world dataset of 15K casually captured dynamic sequences, and D-RE10K-iPhone, a paired transient and clean benchmark for sparse-view transient-aware NVS. Experiments show that WildRayZer consistently outperforms optimization-based and feed-forward baselines in both transient-region removal and full-frame NVS quality with a single feed-forward pass.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a mainstay for many everyday applications. However, as data evolve their knowledge quickly becomes outdated. Continual learning aims to update LLMs with new information without erasing previously acquired knowledge. Although methods such as full fine-tuning can incorporate new data, they are computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge is overwritten. Memory-augmented approaches address this by equipping LLMs with a memory bank, that is an external memory module which stores information for future use. However, these methods face a critical limitation, in particular, the memory bank constantly grows in the real-world scenario when large-scale data streams arrive. In this paper, we propose MBC, a model that compresses the memory bank through a codebook optimization strategy during online adaptation learning. To ensure stable learning, we also introduce an online resetting mechanism that prevents codebook collapse. In addition, we employ Key-Value Low-Rank Adaptation in the attention layers of the LLM, enabling efficient utilization of the compressed memory representations. Experiments with benchmark question-answering datasets demonstrate that MBC reduces the memory bank size to 0.3% when compared against the most competitive baseline, while maintaining high retention accuracy during online adaptation learning.

However, acquiring diverse and realistic multi-turn tool-use data remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a novel text-based paradigm. We observe that textual corpora naturally contain rich, multi-step problem-solving experiences, which can serve as an untapped, scalable, and authentic data source for multi-turn tool-use tasks. Based on this insight, we introduce GEM, a data synthesis pipeline that enables the generation and extraction of multi-turn tool-use trajectories from text corpora through a four-stage process: relevance filtering, workflow & tool extraction, trajectory grounding, and complexity refinement. To reduce the computational cost, we further train a specialized Trajectory Synthesizer via supervised fine-tuning. This model distills the complex generation pipeline into an efficient, end-to-end trajectory generator. Experiments demonstrate that our GEM-32B achieve a 16.5% improvement on the BFCL V3 Multi-turn benchmark. Our models partially surpass the performance of models trained on τ - bench (Airline and Retail) in-domain data, highlighting the superior generalization capability derived from our text-based synthesis paradigm.

      "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as essential generalist robot policies for diverse manipulation tasks, conventionally relying on directly translating multimodal inputs into actions via Vision-Language Model (VLM) embeddings. Recent advancements have introduced explicit intermediary reasoning, such as sub-task prediction (language) or goal image synthesis (vision), to guide action generation. However, these intermediate reasoning are often indirect and inherently limited in their capacity to convey the full, granular information required for precise action execution. Instead, we posit that the most effective form of reasoning is one that deliberates directly in the action space. We introduce Action Chain-of-Thought (ACoT), a paradigm where the reasoning process itself is formulated as a structured sequence of coarse action intents that guide the final policy. In this paper, we propose ACoT-VLA, a novel architecture that materializes the ACoT paradigm. Specifically, we introduce two complementary components: an Explicit Action Reasoner (EAR) and Implicit Action Reasoner (IAR). The former proposes coarse reference trajectories as explicit action-level reasoning steps, while the latter extracts latent action priors from internal representations of multimodal input, co-forming an ACoT that conditions the downstream action head to enable grounded policy learning. Extensive experiments in real-world and simulation environments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, which achieves 98.5%, 84.1%, and 47.4% on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus and VLABench, respectively.",

Humans, by contrast, often reason softly by maintaining a distribution over plausible next steps. Motivated by this, we propose Multiplex Thinking, a stochastic soft reasoning mechanism that, at each thinking step, samples K candidate tokens and aggregates their embeddings into a single continuous multiplex token. This preserves the vocabulary embedding prior and the sampling dynamics of standard discrete generation, while inducing a tractable probability distribution over multiplex rollouts. Consequently, multiplex trajectories can be directly optimized with on-policy reinforcement learning (RL). Importantly, Multiplex Thinking is self-adaptive: when the model is confident, the multiplex token is nearly discrete and behaves like standard CoT; when it is uncertain, it compactly represents multiple plausible next steps without increasing sequence length. Across challenging math reasoning benchmarks, Multiplex Thinking consistently outperforms strong discrete CoT and RL baselines from Pass@1 through Pass@1024, while producing shorter sequences.

We introduce Progress-Aware Consistent Evolution (PACEvolve), a framework designed to robustly govern the agent's context and search dynamics, to address these challenges. PACEvolve combines hierarchical context management (HCM) with pruning to address context pollution; momentum-based backtracking (MBB) to escape local minima; and a self-adaptive sampling policy that unifies backtracking and crossover for dynamic search coordination (CE), allowing agents to balance internal refinement with cross-trajectory collaboration. We demonstrate that PACEvolve provides a systematic path to consistent, long-horizon self-improvement, achieving state-of-the-art results on LLM-SR and KernelBench, while discovering solutions surpassing the record on Modded NanoGPT.",

      "abstract": "Human motion generation from text prompts has made remarkable progress in recent years. However, existing methods primarily rely on either sequence-level or action-level descriptions due to the absence of fine-grained, part-level motion annotations. This limits their controllability over individual body parts. In this work, we construct a high-quality motion dataset with atomic, temporally-aware part-level text annotations, leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior datasets that either provide synchronized part captions with fixed time segments or rely solely on global sequence labels, our dataset captures asynchronous and semantically distinct part movements at fine temporal resolution. Based on this dataset, we introduce a diffusion-based part-aware motion generation framework, namely FrankenMotion, where each body part is guided by its own temporally-structured textual prompt. This is, to our knowledge, the first work to provide atomic, temporally-aware part-level motion annotations and have a model that allows motion generation with both spatial (body part) and temporal (atomic action) control. Experiments demonstrate that FrankenMotion outperforms all previous baseline models adapted and retrained for our setting, and our model can compose motions unseen during training.

For each response, we compute an output-entropy profile from final-layer next-token probabilities (from top-k logprobs) and summarize it with eleven statistics. A lightweight classifier predicts instance correctness, and averaging predicted probabilities yields a domain-level accuracy estimate. We evaluate on ten STEM reasoning benchmarks with exhaustive train/test compositions (k in {1,2,3,4}; all \"10 choose k\" combinations), across nine LLMs from six families (3B-20B). Estimates often track held-out benchmark accuracy, and several models show near-monotonic ordering of domains.

While this approach significantly enhances accuracy with agent policies optimized via large-scale reinforcement learning, we identify a critical gap in reliability: these agents fail to recognize their reasoning boundaries and rarely admit ``I DON'T KNOW'' (IDK) even when evidence is insufficient or reasoning reaches its limit. The lack of reliability often leads to plausible but unreliable answers, introducing significant risks in many real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose Boundary-Aware Policy Optimization (BAPO), a novel RL framework designed to cultivate reliable boundary awareness without compromising accuracy. BAPO introduces two key components: (i) a group-based boundary-aware reward that encourages an IDK response only when the reasoning reaches its limit, and (ii) an adaptive reward modulator that strategically suspends this reward during early exploration, preventing the model from exploiting IDK as a shortcut. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that BAPO substantially enhances the overall reliability of agentic search.",

Our findings reveal pervasive security risks: 26.1% of skills contain at least one vulnerability, spanning 14 distinct patterns across four categories: prompt injection, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, and supply chain risks. Data exfiltration (13.3%) and privilege escalation (11.8%) are most prevalent, while 5.2% of skills exhibit high-severity patterns strongly suggesting malicious intent. We find that skills bundling executable scripts are 2.12x more likely to contain vulnerabilities than instruction-only skills (OR=2.12, p<0.001).

      "abstract": "Consistency learning with feature perturbation is a widely used strategy in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. However, many existing perturbation methods rely on dropout, and thus require a careful manual tuning of the dropout rate, which is a sensitive hyperparameter and often difficult to optimize and may lead to suboptimal regularization. To overcome this limitation, we propose VQ-Seg, the first approach to employ vector quantization (VQ) to discretize the feature space and introduce a novel and controllable Quantized Perturbation Module (QPM) that replaces dropout. Our QPM perturbs discrete representations by shuffling the spatial locations of codebook indices, enabling effective and controllable regularization. To mitigate potential information loss caused by quantization, we design a dual-branch architecture where the post-quantization feature space is shared by both image reconstruction and segmentation tasks. Moreover, we introduce a Post-VQ Feature Adapter (PFA) to incorporate guidance from a foundation model (FM), supplementing the high-level semantic information lost during quantization. Furthermore, we collect a large-scale Lung Cancer (LC) dataset comprising 828 CT scans annotated for central-type lung carcinoma. Extensive experiments on the LC dataset and other public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

      "abstract": "To teach robots complex manipulation tasks, it is now a common practice to fine-tune a pre-trained vision-language-action model (VLA) on task-specific data. However, since this recipe updates existing representations, it is unsuitable for long-term operation in the real world, where robots must continually adapt to new tasks and environments while retaining the knowledge they have already acquired. Existing continual learning methods for robotics commonly require storing previous data (exemplars), struggle with long task sequences, or rely on task identifiers for deployment. To address these limitations, we propose CLARE, a general, parameter-efficient framework for exemplar-free continual learning with VLAs. CLARE introduces lightweight modular adapters into selected feedforward layers and autonomously expands the model only where necessary when learning a new task, guided by layer-wise feature similarity. During deployment, an autoencoder-based routing mechanism dynamically activates the most relevant adapters without requiring task labels. Through extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark, we show that CLARE achieves high performance on new tasks without catastrophic forgetting of earlier tasks, significantly outperforming even exemplar-based methods.

Segmenting these various entities from satellite imagery is crucial for a range of downstream applications. Current advanced segmentation models can reliably segment entities defined by physical attributes (e.g., buildings, water bodies) but still struggle with socially defined categories (e.g., schools, parks). In this work, we achieve socio-semantic segmentation by vision-language model reasoning. To facilitate this, we introduce the Urban Socio-Semantic Segmentation dataset named SocioSeg, a new resource comprising satellite imagery, digital maps, and pixel-level labels of social semantic entities organized in a hierarchical structure. Additionally, we propose a novel vision-language reasoning framework called SocioReasoner that simulates the human process of identifying and annotating social semantic entities via cross-modal recognition and multi-stage reasoning. We employ reinforcement learning to optimize this non-differentiable process and elicit the reasoning capabilities of the vision-language model.

These methods rely on group-relative advantage estimation to avoid learned critics, yet its theoretical properties remain poorly understood.\n  In this work, we uncover a fundamental issue of group-based RL: the group-relative advantage estimator is inherently biased relative to the true (expected) advantage. We provide the first theoretical analysis showing that it systematically underestimates advantages for hard prompts and overestimates them for easy prompts, leading to imbalanced exploration and exploitation. To address this issue, we propose History-Aware Adaptive Difficulty Weighting (HA-DW), an adaptive reweighting scheme that adjusts advantage estimates based on an evolving difficulty anchor and training dynamics. Both theoretical analysis and experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that HA-DW consistently improves performance when integrated into GRPO and its variants. Our results suggest that correcting biased advantage estimation is critical for robust and efficient RLVR training.",

To address this, we propose an automated Coarse-to-Fine Rubric Generation framework. By synergizing principle-guided synthesis, multi-model aggregation, and difficulty evolution, our approach produces comprehensive and highly discriminative criteria capable of capturing the subtle nuances.

We annotated 775 user-specific preferences and 215 routines from 20k long-term records across different users for evaluation. Furthermore, we introduce Hierarchical Intent Memory Agent (HIM-Agent), which maintains a continuously updating personal memory and hierarchically organizes user preferences and routines for personalization. Finally, we evaluate a range of GUI agents on AndroidIntent, including GPT-5, Qwen3-VL, and UI-TARS, further results show that HIM-Agent significantly improves both execution and proactive performance by 15.7% and 7.3%.",

Key tasks include sentiment classification, aspect-based sentiment analysis, and detecting subtle nuances such as irony. The research details the theoretical background, datasets, and methods used, assessing performance of LLMs as measured by accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score. Findings reveal that advanced prompting significantly improves sentiment analysis, with the few-shot approach excelling in GPT-4o-mini and chain-of-thought prompting boosting irony detection in gemini-1.5-flash by up to 46%. Thus, while advanced prompting techniques overall improve performance, the fact that few-shot prompting works best for GPT-4o-mini and chain-of-thought excels in gemini-1.5-flash for irony detection suggests that prompting strategies must be tailored to both the model and the task. This highlights the importance of aligning prompt design with both the LLM's architecture and the semantic complexity of the task.",

      "abstract": "Steering Large Language Models (LLMs) through activation interventions has emerged as a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for alignment and personalization. Recent work on Bi-directional Preference Optimization (BiPO) shows that dense steering vectors can be learned directly from preference data in a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) fashion, enabling control over truthfulness, hallucinations, and safety behaviors. However, dense steering vectors often entangle multiple latent factors due to neuron multi-semanticity, limiting their effectiveness and stability in fine-grained settings such as cultural alignment, where closely related values and behaviors (e.g., among Middle Eastern cultures) must be distinguished. In this paper, we propose Yet another Policy Optimization (YaPO), a reference-free method that learns sparse steering vectors in the latent space of a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). By optimizing sparse codes, YaPO produces disentangled, interpretable, and efficient steering directions. Empirically, we show that YaPO converges faster, achieves stronger performance, and exhibits improved training stability compared to dense steering baselines. Beyond cultural alignment, YaPO generalizes to a range of alignment-related behaviors, including hallucination, wealth-seeking, jailbreak, and power-seeking. Importantly, YaPO preserves general knowledge, with no measurable degradation on MMLU. Overall, our results show that YaPO provides a general recipe for efficient, stable, and fine-grained alignment of LLMs, with broad applications to controllability and domain adaptation.

      "abstract": "Large language models can represent a variety of personas but typically default to a helpful Assistant identity cultivated during post-training. We investigate the structure of the space of model personas by extracting activation directions corresponding to diverse character archetypes. Across several different models, we find that the leading component of this persona space is an \"Assistant Axis,\" which captures the extent to which a model is operating in its default Assistant mode. Steering towards the Assistant direction reinforces helpful and harmless behavior; steering away increases the model's tendency to identify as other entities. Moreover, steering away with more extreme values often induces a mystical, theatrical speaking style. We find this axis is also present in pre-trained models, where it primarily promotes helpful human archetypes like consultants and coaches and inhibits spiritual ones. Measuring deviations along the Assistant Axis predicts \"persona drift,\" a phenomenon where models slip into exhibiting harmful or bizarre behaviors that are uncharacteristic of their typical persona. We find that persona drift is often driven by conversations demanding meta-reflection on the model's processes or featuring emotionally vulnerable users. We show that restricting activations to a fixed region along the Assistant Axis can stabilize model behavior in these scenarios -- and also in the face of adversarial persona-based jailbreaks. Our results suggest that post-training steers models toward a particular region of persona space but only loosely tethers them to it, motivating work on training and steering strategies that more deeply anchor models to a coherent persona.",

To address these failures, we propose two novel complementary remedies. On the data side, we present a procedural data-generation strategy that composes single-image annotations into rich, targeted multi-image training examples. On the optimization side, we analyze layer-wise attention patterns and derive an attention-masking scheme tailored for multi-image inputs. Experiments substantially improved cross-image aggregation, while also enhancing performance on existing multi-image benchmarks, outperforming prior state of the art across tasks.

These patterns play a key role in passing information across tokens. But why do they emerge? In this paper, we demystify the emergence of these Slash-Dominant Heads (SDHs) from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. First, by analyzing open-source LLMs, we find that SDHs are intrinsic to models and generalize to out-of-distribution prompts. To explain the intrinsic emergence, we analyze the queries, keys, and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which jointly determine attention scores. Our empirical analysis reveals two characteristic conditions of SDHs: (1) Queries and keys are almost rank-one, and (2) RoPE is dominated by medium- and high-frequency components. Under these conditions, queries and keys are nearly identical across tokens, and interactions between medium- and high-frequency components of RoPE give rise to SDHs. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically show that these conditions are sufficient to ensure the emergence of SDHs by formalizing them as our modeling assumptions. Particularly, we analyze the training dynamics of a shallow Transformer equipped with RoPE under these conditions, and prove that models trained via gradient descent exhibit SDHs. The SDHs generalize to out-of-distribution prompts.",

We investigate the economic implications of expanding the set of available technologies in three canonical game-theoretic settings: bargaining (resource division), negotiation (asymmetric information trade), and persuasion (strategic information transmission). We find that simply increasing the choice of AI delegates can drastically shift equilibrium payoffs and regulatory outcomes, often creating incentives for regulators to proactively develop and release technologies. Conversely, we identify a strategic phenomenon termed the \"Poisoned Apple\" effect: an agent may release a new technology, which neither they nor their opponent ultimately uses, solely to manipulate the regulator's choice of market design in their favor. This strategic release improves the releaser's welfare at the expense of their opponent and the regulator's fairness objectives. Our findings demonstrate that static regulatory frameworks are vulnerable to manipulation via technology expansion, necessitating dynamic market designs that adapt to the evolving landscape of AI capabilities.",

      "abstract": "Large language models have achieved remarkable capabilities across domains, yet mechanisms underlying sophisticated reasoning remain elusive. Recent reasoning models outperform comparable instruction-tuned models on complex cognitive tasks, attributed to extended computation through longer chains of thought. Here we show that enhanced reasoning emerges not from extended computation alone, but from simulating multi-agent-like interactions -- a society of thought -- which enables diversification and debate among internal cognitive perspectives characterized by distinct personality traits and domain expertise. Through quantitative analysis and mechanistic interpretability methods applied to reasoning traces, we find that reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B exhibit much greater perspective diversity than instruction-tuned models, activating broader conflict between heterogeneous personality- and expertise-related features during reasoning. This multi-agent structure manifests in conversational behaviors, including question-answering, perspective shifts, and the reconciliation of conflicting views, and in socio-emotional roles that characterize sharp back-and-forth conversations, together accounting for the accuracy advantage in reasoning tasks. Controlled reinforcement learning experiments reveal that base models increase conversational behaviors when rewarded solely for reasoning accuracy, and fine-tuning models with conversational scaffolding accelerates reasoning improvement over base models. These findings indicate that the social organization of thought enables effective exploration of solution spaces. We suggest that reasoning models establish a computational parallel to collective intelligence in human groups, where diversity enables superior problem-solving when systematically structured, which suggests new opportunities for agent organization to harness the wisdom of crowds.",

      "abstract": "Character image animation is gaining significant importance across various domains, driven by the demand for robust and flexible multi-subject rendering. While existing methods excel in single-person animation, they struggle to handle arbitrary subject counts, diverse character types, and spatial misalignment between the reference image and the driving poses. We attribute these limitations to an overly rigid spatial binding that forces strict pixel-wise alignment between the pose and reference, and an inability to consistently rebind motion to intended subjects. To address these challenges, we propose CoDance, a novel Unbind-Rebind framework that enables the animation of arbitrary subject counts, types, and spatial configurations conditioned on a single, potentially misaligned pose sequence. Specifically, the Unbind module employs a novel pose shift encoder to break the rigid spatial binding between the pose and the reference by introducing stochastic perturbations to both poses and their latent features, thereby compelling the model to learn a location-agnostic motion representation. To ensure precise control and subject association, we then devise a Rebind module, leveraging semantic guidance from text prompts and spatial guidance from subject masks to direct the learned motion to intended characters. Furthermore, to facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we introduce a new multi-subject CoDanceBench. Extensive experiments on CoDanceBench and existing datasets show that CoDance achieves SOTA performance, exhibiting remarkable generalization across diverse subjects and spatial layouts. The code and weights will be open-sourced.",

      "abstract": "Despite recent progress, medical foundation models still struggle to unify visual understanding and generation, as these tasks have inherently conflicting goals: semantic abstraction versus pixel-level reconstruction. Existing approaches, typically based on parameter-shared autoregressive architectures, frequently lead to compromised performance in one or both tasks. To address this, we present UniX, a next-generation unified medical foundation model for chest X-ray understanding and generation. UniX decouples the two tasks into an autoregressive branch for understanding and a diffusion branch for high-fidelity generation. Crucially, a cross-modal self-attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically guide the generation process with understanding features. Coupled with a rigorous data cleaning pipeline and a multi-stage training strategy, this architecture enables synergistic collaboration between tasks while leveraging the strengths of diffusion models for superior generation. On two representative benchmarks, UniX achieves a 46.1% improvement in understanding performance (Micro-F1) and a 24.2% gain in generation quality (FD-RadDino), using only a quarter of the parameters of LLM-CXR. By achieving performance on par with task-specific models, our work establishes a scalable paradigm for synergistic medical image understanding and generation.

A commonly used unit for comparing models, their inputs and outputs, and estimating inference pricing is the token. In general, tokens are used as a stable currency, assumed to be broadly consistent across tokenizers and contexts, enabling direct comparisons. However, tokenization varies significantly across models and domains of text, making naive interpretation of token counts problematic. We quantify this variation by providing a comprehensive empirical analysis of tokenization, exploring the compression of sequences to tokens across different distributions of textual data. Our analysis challenges commonly held heuristics about token lengths, finding them to be overly simplistic.

However, it is unclear whether these explanations generalize, i.e. whether they capture general patterns about the underlying problem rather than patterns which are esoteric to the LRM. This is a crucial question in understanding or discovering new concepts, e.g. in AI for science. We study this generalization question by evaluating a specific notion of generalizability: whether explanations produced by one LRM induce the same behavior when given to other LRMs. We find that CoT explanations often exhibit this form of generalization (i.e. they increase consistency between LRMs) and that this increased generalization is correlated with human preference rankings and post-training with reinforcement learning. We further analyze the conditions under which explanations yield consistent answers and propose a straightforward, sentence-level ensembling strategy that improves consistency. Taken together, these results prescribe caution when using LRM explanations to yield new insights and outline a framework for characterizing LRM explanation generalization.",

Capturing these dynamics requires maintaining temporally consistent instance identities across intermittently captured 3D scans, even when changes are unobserved. We introduce and formalize the task of temporally sparse 4D indoor semantic instance segmentation (SIS), which jointly segments, identifies, and temporally associates object instances. This setting poses a challenge for existing 3DSIS methods, which require a discrete matching step due to their lack of temporal reasoning, and for 4D LiDAR approaches, which perform poorly due to their reliance on high-frequency temporal measurements that are uncommon in the longer-horizon evolution of indoor environments. We propose ReScene4D, a novel method that adapts 3DSIS architectures for 4DSIS without needing dense observations. It explores strategies to share information across observations, demonstrating that this shared context not only enables consistent instance tracking but also improves standard 3DSIS quality. To evaluate this task, we define a new metric, t-mAP, that extends mAP to reward temporal identity consistency. ReScene4D achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3RScan dataset, establishing a new benchmark for understanding evolving indoor scenes.",

Current datasets differ substantially in structure and are time-consuming to access and process, which impedes data integration and reduces the comparability and generalizability of algorithmic developments. This work aims to establish a unified and accessible data resource for T1D algorithm development. Multiple publicly available T1D datasets were consolidated into a unified resource, termed the MetaboNet dataset. Inclusion required the availability of both continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and corresponding insulin pump dosing records. Additionally, auxiliary information such as reported carbohydrate intake and physical activity was retained when present. The MetaboNet dataset comprises 3135 subjects and 1228 patient-years of overlapping CGM and insulin data, making it substantially larger than existing standalone benchmark datasets. The resource is distributed as a fully public subset available for immediate download at https://metabo-net.org/ , and with a Data Use Agreement (DUA)-restricted subset accessible through their respective application processes. For the datasets in the latter subset, processing pipelines are provided to automatically convert the data into the standardized MetaboNet format. A consolidated public dataset for T1D research is presented, and the access pathways for both its unrestricted and DUA-governed components are described. The resulting dataset covers a broad range of glycemic profiles and demographics and thus can yield more generalizable algorithmic performance than individual datasets.",

Conventional machine learning (ML) models are effective in several domains, yet they struggle to represent the complexities observed in smart grid systems. Furthermore, traditional ML models are highly susceptible to adversarial manipulations, making them increasingly unreliable for real-world deployment. Quantum ML (QML) provides a unique advantage, utilizing quantum-enhanced feature representations to model the intricacies of the high-dimensional nature of smart grid systems while demonstrating greater resilience to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we propose QUPID, a partitioned quantum neural network (PQNN) that outperforms traditional state-of-the-art ML models in anomaly detection. We extend our model to R-QUPID that even maintains its performance when including differential privacy (DP) for enhanced robustness. Moreover, our partitioning framework addresses a significant scalability problem in QML by efficiently distributing computational workloads, making quantum-enhanced anomaly detection practical in large-scale smart grid environments. Our experimental results across various scenarios exemplifies the efficacy of QUPID and R-QUPID to significantly improve anomaly detection capabilities and robustness compared to traditional ML approaches.",

Instead of analyzing convergence via Markov-chain transition kernels or drift arguments, we ex press the survival probability of a measurable target set $A$ as a product of conditional first-hit probabilities (hazards) $p_t=\\Prob(E_t\\mid\\mathcal F_{t-1})$. This yields distribution-free identities for survival and explicit tail bounds whenever deterministic lower bounds on the hazard hold on the survival event.\n  For the L-SHADE algorithm with current-to-$p$best/1 mutation, we construct a checkable algorithmic witness event $\\mathcal L_t$ under which the conditional hazard admits an explicit lower bound depending only on sampling rules, population size, and crossover statistics. This separates theoretical constants from empirical event frequencies and explains why worst-case constant-hazard bounds are typically conservative.\n  We complement the theory with a Kaplan--Meier survival analysis on the CEC2017 benchmark suite . Across functions and budgets, we identify three distinct empirical regimes: (i) strongly clustered success, where hitting times concentrate in short bursts; (ii) approximately geometric tails, where a constant-hazard model is accurate; and (iii) intractable cases with no observed hits within the evaluation horizon. The results show that while constant-hazard bounds provide valid tail envelopes, the practical behavior of L-SHADE is governed by burst-like transitions rather than homogeneous per-generati on success probabilities.",

Although modern ES systems achieve high accuracy using powerful neural models, their deployment typically relies on CPU or GPU infrastructures that are energy-intensive and poorly suited for real-time inference in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we explore the feasibility of implementing McDonald-style extractive summarization on a low-power CMOS coupled oscillator-based Ising machine (COBI) that supports integer-valued, all-to-all spin couplings. We first propose a hardware-aware Ising formulation that reduces the scale imbalance between local fields and coupling terms, thereby improving robustness to coefficient quantization: this method can be applied to any problem formulation that requires k of n variables to be chosen. We then develop a complete ES pipeline including (i) stochastic rounding and iterative refinement to compensate for precision loss, and (ii) a decomposition strategy that partitions a large ES problem into smaller Ising subproblems that can be efficiently solved on COBI and later combined. Experimental results on the CNN/DailyMail dataset show that our pipeline can produce high-quality summaries using only integer-coupled Ising hardware with limited precision. COBI achieves 3-4.5x runtime speedups compared to a brute-force method, which is comparable to software Tabu search, and two to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy, while maintaining competitive summary quality. These results highlight the potential of deploying CMOS Ising solvers for real-time, low-energy text summarization on edge devices.",

To address this, we present CTest-Metric, a first unified metric assessment framework with three modules determining the clinical feasibility of metrics for CT RRG. The modules test: (i) Writing Style Generalizability (WSG) via LLM-based rephrasing; (ii) Synthetic Error Injection (SEI) at graded severities; and (iii) Metrics-vs-Expert correlation (MvE) using clinician ratings on 175 \"disagreement\" cases. Eight widely used metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore-F1, F1-RadGraph, RaTEScore, GREEN Score, CRG) are studied across seven LLMs built on a CT-CLIP encoder. Using our novel framework, we found that lexical NLG metrics are highly sensitive to stylistic variations; GREEN Score aligns best with expert judgments (Spearman~0.70), while CRG shows negative correlation; and BERTScore-F1 is least sensitive to factual error injection. We will release the framework, code, and allowable portion of the anonymized evaluation data (rephrased/error-injected CT reports), to facilitate reproducible benchmarking and future metric development.",

      "abstract": "Ethiopia's Ministry of Health is upgrading health posts to improve access to essential services, particularly in rural areas. Limited resources, however, require careful prioritization of which facilities to upgrade to maximize population coverage while accounting for diverse expert and stakeholder preferences. In collaboration with the Ethiopian Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we propose a hybrid framework that systematically integrates expert knowledge with optimization techniques. Classical optimization methods provide theoretical guarantees but require explicit, quantitative objectives, whereas stakeholder criteria are often articulated in natural language and difficult to formalize. To bridge these domains, we develop the Large language model and Extended Greedy (LEG) framework. Our framework combines a provable approximation algorithm for population coverage optimization with LLM-driven iterative refinement that incorporates human-AI alignment to ensure solutions reflect expert qualitative guidance while preserving coverage guarantees. Experiments on real-world data from three Ethiopian regions demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and its potential to inform equitable, data-driven health system planning.",

      "abstract": "Dense Associative Memory (DAM) models generalize the classical Hopfield model by incorporating n-body or exponential interactions that greatly enhance storage capacity. While the criticality of DAM models has been largely investigated, mainly within a statistical equilibrium picture, little attention has been devoted to the temporal self-organizing behavior induced by learning. In this work, we investigate the behavior of a stochastic exponential DAM (SEDAM) model through the lens of Temporal Complexity (TC), a framework that characterizes complex systems by intermittent transition events between order and disorder and by scale-free temporal statistics. Transition events associated with birth-death of neural avalanche structures are exploited for the TC analyses and compared with analogous transition events based on coincidence structures. We systematically explore how TC indicators depend on control parameters, i.e., noise intensity and memory load. Our results reveal that the SEDAM model exhibits regimes of complex intermittency characterized by nontrivial temporal correlations and scale-free behavior, indicating the spontaneous emergence of self-organizing dynamics. These regimes emerge in small intervals of noise intensity values, which, in agreement with the extended criticality concept, never shrink to a single critical point. Further, the noise intensity range needed to reach the critical region, where self-organizing behavior emerges, slightly decreases as the memory load increases. This study highlights the relevance of TC as a complementary framework for understanding learning and information processing in artificial and biological neural systems, revealing the link between the memory load and the self-organizing capacity of the network.",

      "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are emerging as highly effective planning models for end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, current works mostly rely on imitation learning from sparse trajectory annotations and under-utilize their potential as generative models. We propose Generative Scenario Rollouts (GeRo), a plug-and-play framework for VLA models that jointly performs planning and generation of language-grounded future traffic scenes through an autoregressive rollout strategy. First, a VLA model is trained to encode ego vehicle and agent dynamics into latent tokens under supervision from planning, motion, and language tasks, facilitating text-aligned generation. Next, GeRo performs language-conditioned autoregressive generation. Given multi-view images, a scenario description, and ego-action questions, it generates future latent tokens and textual responses to guide long-horizon rollouts. A rollout-consistency loss stabilizes predictions using ground truth or pseudo-labels, mitigating drift and preserving text-action alignment. This design enables GeRo to perform temporally consistent, language-grounded rollouts that support long-horizon reasoning and multi-agent planning. On Bench2Drive, GeRo improves driving score and success rate by +15.7 and +26.2, respectively. By integrating reinforcement learning with generative rollouts, GeRo achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop and open-loop performance, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness. These results highlight the promise of generative, language-conditioned reasoning as a foundation for safer and more interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving.",

      "abstract": "Transformer pretraining is increasingly constrained by memory and compute requirements, with the key-value (KV) cache emerging as a dominant bottleneck during training and autoregressive decoding. We propose \\textit{low-rank KV adaptation} (LRKV), a simple modification of multi-head attention that reduces KV cache memory by exploiting redundancy across attention heads while preserving full token-level resolution. Each layer uses a shared full-rank KV projection augmented with low-rank, head-specific residuals, yielding a continuous trade-off between complete sharing and fully independent attention.\n  LRKV is a drop-in replacement for standard multi-head attention and directly subsumes query-sharing approaches such as multi-query and grouped-query attention, while remaining distinct from latent-compression methods such as multi-latent attention (MLA). Across large-scale pretraining experiments, LRKV consistently achieves faster loss reduction, lower validation perplexity, and stronger downstream task performance than standard attention, MQA/GQA, and MLA. At the 2.5B scale, LRKV outperforms standard attention while using roughly half the KV cache, and reaches equivalent model quality with up to \\textbf{20-25\\% less training compute} when measured in cumulative FLOPs. To explain these gains, we analyze attention head structure in operator space and show that LRKV preserves nearly all functional head diversity relative to standard attention, whereas more aggressive KV-sharing mechanisms rely on compensatory query specialization. Together, these results establish LRKV as a practical and effective attention mechanism for scaling Transformer pretraining under memory- and compute-constrained regimes.",

The extension consists of comprehensively evaluating its generality, semantic leverage, and reasoning mechanisms, also across multiple Key Performance Indicators. Empirical evaluations conducted on three distinct event logs and across the Key Performance Indicators of Total Time and Activity Occurrence prediction indicate that, in data-scarce settings with only 100 traces, the LLM surpasses the benchmark methods. Furthermore, the experiments also show that the LLM exploits both its embodied prior knowledge and the internal correlations among training traces. Finally, we examine the reasoning strategies employed by the model, demonstrating that the LLM does not merely replicate existing predictive methods but performs higher-order reasoning to generate the predictions.",

In this work, we present MHA2MLA-VLM, a parameter-efficient and multimodal-aware framework for converting off-the-shelf VLMs to MLA. Our approach features two core techniques: (1) a modality-adaptive partial-RoPE strategy that supports both traditional and multimodal settings by selectively masking nonessential dimensions, and (2) a modality-decoupled low-rank approximation method that independently compresses the visual and textual KV spaces. Furthermore, we introduce parameter-efficient fine-tuning to minimize adaptation cost and demonstrate that minimizing output activation error, rather than parameter distance, substantially reduces performance loss. Extensive experiments on three representative VLMs show that MHA2MLA-VLM restores original model performance with minimal supervised data, significantly reduces KV cache footprint, and integrates seamlessly with KV quantization.",

      "abstract": "Learning structured task representations from human demonstrations is essential for understanding long-horizon manipulation behaviors, particularly in bimanual settings where action ordering, object involvement, and interaction geometry can vary significantly. A key challenge lies in jointly capturing the discrete semantic structure of tasks and the temporal evolution of object-centric geometric relations in a form that supports reasoning over task progression. In this work, we introduce a semantic-geometric task graph-representation that encodes object identities, inter-object relations, and their temporal geometric evolution from human demonstrations. Building on this formulation, we propose a learning framework that combines a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) encoder with a Transformer-based decoder, decoupling scene representation learning from action-conditioned reasoning about task progression. The encoder operates solely on temporal scene graphs to learn structured representations, while the decoder conditions on action-context to predict future action sequences, associated objects, and object motions over extended time horizons. Through extensive evaluation on human demonstration datasets, we show that semantic-geometric task graph-representations are particularly beneficial for tasks with high action and object variability, where simpler sequence-based models struggle to capture task progression. Finally, we demonstrate that task graph representations can be transferred to a physical bimanual robot and used for online action selection, highlighting their potential as reusable task abstractions for downstream decision-making in manipulation systems.",

This paper tackles this AXI vulnerability issue and presents an intelligent hardware monitoring system (IMS) for real-time detection of AXI protocol violations. IMS is a hardware module leveraging neural networks to achieve high detection accuracy. For model training, we perform DoS attacks through header-field manipulation and systematic malicious operations, while recording AXI transactions to build a training dataset. We then deploy a quantization-optimized neural network, achieving 98.7% detection accuracy with <=3% latency overhead, and throughput of >2.5 million inferences/s. We subsequently integrate this IMS into a RISC-V SoC as a memory-mapped IP core to monitor its AXI bus. For demonstration and initial assessment for later ASIC integration, we implemented this IMS on an AMD Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU104 board, showing an overall small hardware footprint (9.04% look-up-tables (LUTs), 0.23% DSP slices, and 0.70% flip-flops) and negligible impact on the overall design's achievable frequency.

We find that while ensembling the scores generally improves the score-matching loss and model likelihood, it fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics such as FID on image datasets. We confirm this observation across a breadth of aggregation rules using Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout, on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by investigating possible explanations, such as the link between score estimation and image quality. We also look into tabular data through random forests, and find that one aggregation strategy outperforms the others. Finally, we provide theoretical insights into the summing of score models, which shed light not only on ensembling but also on several model composition techniques (e.g. guidance).",

      "abstract": "We propose Map2Thought, a framework that enables explicit and interpretable spatial reasoning for 3D VLMs. The framework is grounded in two key components: Metric Cognitive Map (Metric-CogMap) and Cognitive Chain-of-Thought (Cog-CoT). Metric-CogMap provides a unified spatial representation by integrating a discrete grid for relational reasoning with a continuous, metric-scale representation for precise geometric understanding. Building upon the Metric-CogMap, Cog-CoT performs explicit geometric reasoning through deterministic operations, including vector operations, bounding-box distances, and occlusion-aware appearance order cues, producing interpretable inference traces grounded in 3D structure. Experimental results show that Map2Thought enables explainable 3D understanding, achieving 59.9% accuracy using only half the supervision, closely matching the 60.9% baseline trained with the full dataset. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5.3%, 4.8%, and 4.0% under 10%, 25%, and 50% training subsets, respectively, on the VSI-Bench.",

Model editing has emerged as an effective approach to mitigate these issues. Existing model editing methods often focus on optimizing an information matrix that blends new and old knowledge. While effective, these approaches can be computationally expensive and may cause conflicts. In contrast, we shift our attention to Hierarchical Orthogonal Residual SprEad of the information matrix, which reduces noisy gradients and enables more stable edits from a different perspective. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method HORSE through a clear theoretical comparison with several popular methods and extensive experiments conducted on two datasets across multiple LLMs. The results show that HORSE maintains precise massive editing across diverse scenarios.

      "abstract": "Urban wind flow reconstruction is essential for assessing air quality, heat dispersion, and pedestrian comfort, yet remains challenging when only sparse sensor data are available. We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism: the unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes. Experiments are conducted on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of a real urban neighbourhood in Bristol, United Kingdom, at a characteristic Reynolds number of $\\mathrm{Re}\\approx2\\times10^{7}$, featuring complex building geometry and irregular terrain. The proposed framework provides a scalable path toward generative, geometry-aware data assimilation for environmental monitoring in complex domains.",

The methods are benchmarked using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia data set, achieving up to 94.28% accuracy and a $jκ$ index of 0.683 on a four-class classification problem. Our models use between 2.89k and 6.17k FLOPs, including preprocessing and readout, which is three to six orders of magnitude less compared to SOTA methods. A novel preprocessing method is utilized that attains superior performance compared to existing methods for both the mixed-patient and inter-patient paradigms. In addition, a novel method for training the Lookup Tables (LUTs) in LUTNs is devised that uses the Boolean equation of a multiplexer (MUX). Additionally, rate coding was utilized for the first time in these LGNs and LUTNs, enhancing the performance of LGNs. Furthermore, it is the first time that LGNs and LUTNs have been benchmarked on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset using the inter-patient paradigm. Using an Artix 7 FPGA, between 2000 and 2990 LUTs were needed, and between 5 to 7 mW (i.e. 50 pJ to 70 pJ per inference) was estimated for running these models. The performance in terms of both accuracy and $jκ$-index is significantly higher compared to previous LGN results. These positive results suggest that one can utilize LGNs and LUTNs for the detection of arrhythmias at extremely low power and high speeds in heart implants or wearable devices, even for patients not included in the training set.",

We focus on hallucinations of answers to questions like: \"Which instrument did Glenn Gould play?\", but we ask these questions for synthetic entities that are unknown to the model. Surprisingly, we find that medium-size models like Gemma-7B-IT frequently hallucinate, i.e., they have difficulty recognizing that the hallucinated fact is not part of their knowledge. We hypothesize that an important factor in causing these hallucinations is the linearity of the relation: linear relations tend to be stored more abstractly, making it difficult for the LLM to assess its knowledge; the facts of nonlinear relations tend to be stored more directly, making knowledge assessment easier. To investigate this hypothesis, we create SyntHal, a dataset of 6000 synthetic entities for six relations. In our experiments with four models, we determine, for each relation, the hallucination rate on SyntHal and also measure its linearity, using $Δ\\cos$. We find a strong correlation ($r \\in [.78,.82]$) between relational linearity and hallucination rate, providing evidence for our hypothesis that the underlying storage of triples of a relation is a factor in how well a model can self-assess its knowledge. This finding has implications for how to manage hallucination behavior and suggests new research directions for improving the representation of factual knowledge in LLMs.",

We present a systematic stress-testing framework that probes failure modes of FNOs across five qualitatively different PDE families: dispersive, elliptic, multi-scale fluid, financial, and chaotic systems. Rather than optimizing in-distribution accuracy, we design controlled stress tests--including parameter shifts, boundary or terminal condition changes, resolution extrapolation with spectral analysis, and iterative rollouts--to expose vulnerabilities such as spectral bias, compounding integration errors, and overfitting to restricted boundary regimes. Our large-scale evaluation (1{,}000 trained models) reveals that distribution shifts in parameters or boundary conditions can inflate errors by more than an order of magnitude, while resolution changes primarily concentrate error in high-frequency modes. Input perturbations generally do not amplify error, though worst-case scenarios (e.g., localized Poisson perturbations) remain challenging. These findings provide a comparative failure-mode atlas and actionable insights for improving robustness in operator learning.",

We collect a large amount of trajectory data on different robotic platforms and evaluate several baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that the GM-100 tasks are 1) feasible to execute and 2) sufficiently challenging to effectively differentiate the performance of current VLA models.

We address the robust nonlinear regression based on the so-called interval conditional value-at-risk (In-CVaR), which is introduced to enhance robustness by trimming extreme losses. While recent literature shows that the In-CVaR based statistical learning exhibits superior robustness performance than classical robust regression models, its theoretical robustness analysis for nonlinear regression remains largely unexplored. We rigorously quantify robustness under contamination, with a unified study of distributional breakdown point for a broad class of regression models, including linear, piecewise affine and neural network models with $\\ell_1$, $\\ell_2$ and Huber losses. Moreover, we analyze the qualitative robustness of the In-CVaR based estimator under perturbation. We show that under several minor assumptions, the In-CVaR based estimator is qualitatively robust in terms of the Prokhorov metric if and only if the largest portion of losses is trimmed. Overall, this study analyzes robustness properties of In-CVaR based nonlinear regression models under both perturbation and contamination, which illustrates the advantages of In-CVaR risk measure over conditional value-at-risk and expectation for robust regression in both theory and numerical experiments.",

In discrete fault regimes (CWRU), it achieves strong window-level discrimination (AUC_win about 0.90) and file-level separability approaching unity (AUC_file about 0.99). Electrically dominated vibration signals (VSB) show weak, non-selective behavior, delineating a physical boundary for transfer.\n  Under a matched IMS controlled-split protocol, a generic EfficientNet-B0 encoder pretrained on ImageNet collapses in the intermittent regime (Lambda_tail about 2), while the interferometric operator retains strong extreme-event selectivity (Lambda_tail about 860), indicating that the effect is not a generic property of CNN features.

      "abstract": "Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) is a widely used heuristic method for solving combinatorial optimization problems. ALNS explores the solution space by iteratively using destroy and repair operators with probabilities, which are adjusted by an adaptive mechanism to find optimal solutions. However, the classic ALNS adaptive mechanism does not consider the interaction between destroy and repair operators when selecting them. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a novel adaptive mechanism. This mechanism enhances the adaptability of the algorithm through a Dual Actor-Critic (DAC) model, which fully considers the fact that the quality of new solutions is jointly determined by the destroy and repair operators. It effectively utilizes the interaction between these operators during the weight adjustment process, greatly improving the adaptability of the ALNS algorithm. In this mechanism, the destroy and repair processes are modeled as independent Markov Decision Processes to guide the selection of operators more accurately. Furthermore, we use Graph Neural Networks to extract key features from problem instances and perform effective aggregation and normalization to enhance the algorithm's transferability to different sizes and characteristics of problems. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed DAC-ALNS algorithm significantly improves solution efficiency and exhibits excellent transferability.",

      "abstract": "Existing research highlights the crucial role of topological priors in image segmentation, particularly in preserving essential structures such as connectivity and genus. Accurately capturing these topological features often requires incorporating width-related information, including the thickness and length inherent to the image structures. However, traditional mathematical definitions of topological structures lack this dimensional width information, limiting methods like persistent homology from fully addressing practical segmentation needs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel mathematical framework that explicitly integrates width information into the characterization of topological structures. This method leverages persistent homology, complemented by smoothing concepts from partial differential equations (PDEs), to modify local extrema of upper-level sets. This approach enables the resulting topological structures to inherently capture width properties. We incorporate this enhanced topological description into variational image segmentation models. Using some proper loss functions, we are also able to design neural networks that can segment images with the required topological and width properties. Through variational constraints on the relevant topological energies, our approach successfully preserves essential topological invariants such as connectivity and genus counts, simultaneously ensuring that segmented structures retain critical width attributes, including line thickness and length. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showcasing its capability to maintain topological fidelity while explicitly embedding width characteristics into segmented image structures.",

      "abstract": "Surface defects on Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) directly compromise product reliability and safety. However, achieving high-precision detection is challenging because PCB defects are typically characterized by tiny sizes, high texture similarity, and uneven scale distributions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework based on YOLOv11n, named SME-YOLO (Small-target Multi-scale Enhanced YOLO). First, we employ the Normalized Wasserstein Distance Loss (NWDLoss). This metric effectively mitigates the sensitivity of Intersection over Union (IoU) to positional deviations in tiny objects. Second, the original upsampling module is replaced by the Efficient Upsampling Convolution Block (EUCB). By utilizing multi-scale convolutions, the EUCB gradually recovers spatial resolution and enhances the preservation of edge and texture details for tiny defects. Finally, this paper proposes the Multi-Scale Focused Attention (MSFA) module. Tailored to the specific spatial distribution of PCB defects, this module adaptively strengthens perception within key scale intervals, achieving efficient fusion of local fine-grained features and global context information. Experimental results on the PKU-PCB dataset demonstrate that SME-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, compared to the baseline YOLOv11n, SME-YOLO improves mAP by 2.2% and Precision by 4%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Graph-based Markov decision processes (GMDPs) capture such settings via an influence graph, but standard critics are poorly aligned with this structure: global value functions provide weak per-agent learning signals, while existing local constructions can be difficult to estimate and ill-behaved in infinite-horizon settings. We introduce the Diffusion Value Function (DVF), a factored value function for GMDPs that assigns to each agent a value component by diffusing rewards over the influence graph with temporal discounting and spatial attenuation. We show that DVF is well-defined, admits a Bellman fixed point, and decomposes the global discounted value via an averaging property. DVF can be used as a drop-in critic in standard RL algorithms and estimated scalably with graph neural networks. Building on DVF, we propose Diffusion A2C (DA2C) and a sparse message-passing actor, Learned DropEdge GNN (LD-GNN), for learning decentralised algorithms under communication costs. Across the firefighting benchmark and three distributed computation tasks (vector graph colouring and two transmit power optimisation problems), DA2C consistently outperforms local and global critic baselines, improving average reward by up to 11%.",

To overcome these limitations, we propose WetSAM, a SAM-based framework that integrates satellite image time series for wetland mapping from sparse point supervision through a dual-branch design, where a temporally prompted branch extends SAM with hierarchical adapters and dynamic temporal aggregation to disentangle wetland characteristics from phenological variability, and a spatial branch employs a temporally constrained region-growing strategy to generate reliable dense pseudo-labels, while a bidirectional consistency regularization jointly optimizes both branches. Extensive experiments across eight global regions of approximately 5,000 km2 each demonstrate that WetSAM substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average F1-score of 85.58%, and delivering accurate and structurally consistent wetland segmentation with minimal labeling effort, highlighting its strong generalization capability and potential for scalable, low-cost, high-resolution wetland mapping.",

Our approach uses two autoencoders, one for the parameter space and one for the observation space, connected by learned mappings between the autoencoders' latent spaces. These mappings enable a surrogate for regularized inversion and optimization in low-dimensional, informative latent spaces. Our flexible framework can work with partial, noisy, or out-of-distribution data, all while maintaining consistency with the underlying physical models. The paired autoencoders enable reconstruction of corrupted data, and then use the reconstructed data for parameter estimation, which produces more accurate reconstructions compared to paired autoencoders alone and end-to-end encoder-decoders of the same architecture, especially in scenarios with data inconsistencies. We demonstrate our approaches on two imaging examples in medical tomography and geophysical seismic-waveform inversion, but the described approaches are broadly applicable to a variety of inverse problems in scientific and engineering applications.",

However, such a refined representation for scene understanding incurs prohibitive computation and memory overhead, posing a major barrier to practical real-time deployment. To address this, we propose SUG-Occ, an explicit Semantics and Uncertainty Guided Sparse Learning Enabled 3D Occupancy Prediction Framework, which exploits the inherent sparsity of 3D scenes to reduce redundant computation while maintaining geometric and semantic completeness. Specifically, we first utilize semantic and uncertainty priors to suppress projections from free space during view transformation while employing an explicit unsigned distance encoding to enhance geometric consistency, producing a structurally consistent sparse 3D representation. Secondly, we design an cascade sparse completion module via hyper cross sparse convolution and generative upsampling to enable efficiently coarse-to-fine reasoning. Finally, we devise an object contextual representation (OCR) based mask decoder that aggregates global semantic context from sparse features and refines voxel-wise predictions via lightweight query-context interactions, avoiding expensive attention operations over volumetric features. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI benchmark demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the baselines, achieving a 7.34/% improvement in accuracy and a 57.8\\% gain in efficiency.",

Intrinsic noise in CIR triplets incurs intrinsic uncertainty and threatens the model's robustness. Probabilistic learning approaches have shown promise in addressing such issues; however, they fall short for CIR due to their instance-level holistic modeling and homogeneous treatment of queries and targets. This paper introduces a Heterogeneous Uncertainty-Guided (HUG) paradigm to overcome these limitations. HUG utilizes a fine-grained probabilistic learning framework, where queries and targets are represented by Gaussian embeddings that capture detailed concepts and uncertainties. We customize heterogeneous uncertainty estimations for multi-modal queries and uni-modal targets. Given a query, we capture uncertainties not only regarding uni-modal content quality but also multi-modal coordination, followed by a provable dynamic weighting mechanism to derive comprehensive query uncertainty. We further design uncertainty-guided objectives, including query-target holistic contrast and fine-grained contrasts with comprehensive negative sampling strategies, which effectively enhance discriminative learning. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate HUG's effectiveness beyond state-of-the-art baselines, with faithful analysis justifying the technical contributions.",

This approach partitions the available time budget into two phases: a probing phase that explores different sets of hyperparameters using configurable hyperparameter optimization methods, followed by a solving phase where the best configuration found is used to tackle the problem within the remaining time.\n  We implement and compare two hyperparameter optimization methods within the probe and solve algorithm: Bayesian optimization and Hamming distance search. We evaluate the algorithm on two different constraint programming solvers, ACE and Choco, across 114 combinatorial problem instances, comparing their performance against the solver's default configurations.\n  Results show that using Bayesian optimization, the algorithm outperforms the solver's default configurations, improving solution quality for ACE in 25.4% of instances and matching the default performance in 57.9%, and for Choco, achieving superior results in 38.6% of instances.

We propose a framework to evaluate an LLM's decision logic in recruitment, by drawing on established economic methodologies for analyzing human hiring behavior. We build synthetic datasets from real freelancer profiles and project descriptions from a major European online freelance marketplace and apply a full factorial design to estimate how a LLM weighs different match-relevant criteria when evaluating freelancer-project fit. We identify which attributes the LLM prioritizes and analyze how these weights vary across project contexts and demographic subgroups. Finally, we explain how a comparable experimental setup could be implemented with human recruiters to assess alignment between model and human decisions. Our findings reveal that the LLM weighs core productivity signals, such as skills and experience, but interprets certain features beyond their explicit matching value. While showing minimal average discrimination against minority groups, intersectional effects reveal that productivity signals carry different weights between demographic groups.",

While scientific text generation has been widely studied, its evaluation remains a challenging and open problem. It is critical to develop models that can be reliably deployed for evaluating diverse open-ended scientific writing tasks while adhering to their distinct requirements. However, existing LLM-based judges and reward models are primarily optimized for general-purpose benchmarks with fixed scoring rubrics and evaluation criteria. Consequently, they often fail to reason over sparse knowledge of scientific domains when interpreting task-dependent and multi-faceted criteria. Moreover, fine-tuning for each individual task is costly and impractical for low-resource settings. To bridge these gaps, we propose cost-efficient, open-source reward models tailored for scientific writing evaluation. We introduce a two-stage training framework that initially optimizes scientific evaluation preferences and then refines reasoning capabilities. Our multi-aspect evaluation design and joint training across diverse tasks enable fine-grained assessment and robustness to dynamic criteria and scoring rubrics. Experimental analysis shows that our training regime strongly improves LLM-based scientific writing evaluation. Our models generalize effectively across tasks and to previously unseen scientific writing evaluation settings, allowing a single trained evaluator to be reused without task-specific retraining.",

This paper advances an experimental framework for evaluating Institutional AI, our system-level approach to AI alignment that reframes alignment from preference engineering in agent-space to mechanism design in institution-space. Central to this approach is the governance graph, a public, immutable manifest that declares legal states, transitions, sanctions, and restorative paths; an Oracle/Controller runtime interprets this manifest, attaching enforceable consequences to evidence of coordination while recording a cryptographically keyed, append-only governance log for audit and provenance. We apply the Institutional AI framework to govern the Cournot collusion case documented by prior work and compare three regimes: Ungoverned (baseline incentives from the structure of the Cournot market), Constitutional (a prompt-only policy-as-prompt prohibition implemented as a fixed written anti-collusion constitution, and Institutional (governance-graph-based). Across six model configurations including cross-provider pairs (N=90 runs/condition), the Institutional regime produces large reductions in collusion: mean tier falls from 3.1 to 1.8 (Cohen's d=1.28), and severe-collusion incidence drops from 50% to 5.6%. The prompt-only Constitutional baseline yields no reliable improvement, illustrating that declarative prohibitions do not bind under optimisation pressure. These results suggest that multi-agent alignment may benefit from being framed as an institutional design problem, where governance graphs can provide a tractable abstraction for alignment-relevant collective behavior.",

      "abstract": "Recent progress in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly advanced video understanding. However, their performance on long-form videos remains limited by computational constraints and suboptimal frame selection. We present Think-Clip-Sample (TCS), a training-free framework that enhances long video understanding through two key components: (i) Multi-Query Reasoning, which generates multiple queries to capture complementary aspects of the question and video; and (ii) Clip-level Slow-Fast Sampling, which adaptively balances dense local details and sparse global context. Extensive experiments on MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VideoMME demonstrate that TCS consistently improves performance across different MLLMs, boosting up to 6.9% accuracy, and is capable of achieving comparable accuracy with 50% fewer inference time cost, highlighting both efficiency and efficacy of TCS on long video understanding.",

      "abstract": "Climate change is intensifying human heat exposure, particularly in densely built urban centers of the Global South. Low-cost construction materials and high thermal-mass surfaces further exacerbate this risk. Yet scalable methods for assessing such heat-relevant building attributes remain scarce. We propose a machine learning framework that fuses openly available unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and street-view (SV) imagery via a coupled global context vision transformer (CGCViT) to learn heat-relevant representations of urban structures. Thermal infrared (TIR) measurements from HotSat-1 are used to quantify the relationship between building attributes and heat-associated health risks. Our dual-modality cross-view learning approach outperforms the best single-modality models by up to $9.3\\%$, demonstrating that UAV and SV imagery provide valuable complementary perspectives on urban structures. The presence of vegetation surrounding buildings (versus no vegetation), brighter roofing (versus darker roofing), and roofing made of concrete, clay, or wood (versus metal or tarpaulin) are all significantly associated with lower HotSat-1 TIR values. Deployed across the city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the proposed framework illustrates how household-level inequalities in heat exposure - often linked to socio-economic disadvantage and reflected in building materials - can be identified and addressed using machine learning. Our results point to the critical role of localized, data-driven risk assessment in shaping climate adaptation strategies that deliver equitable outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Energy efficiency has become an integral aspect of modern computing infrastructure design, impacting the performance, cost, scalability, and durability of production systems. The incorporation of power actuation and sensing capabilities in CPU designs is indicative of this, enabling the deployment of system software that can actively monitor and adjust energy consumption and performance at runtime. While reinforcement learning (RL) would seem ideal for the design of such energy efficiency control systems, online training presents challenges ranging from the lack of proper models for setting up an adequate simulated environment, to perturbation (noise) and reliability issues, if training is deployed on a live system.\n  In this paper we discuss the use of offline reinforcement learning as an alternative approach for the design of an autonomous CPU power controller, with the goal of improving the energy efficiency of parallel applications at runtime without unduly impacting their performance. Offline RL sidesteps the issues incurred by online RL training by leveraging a dataset of state transitions collected from arbitrary policies prior to training.\n  Our methodology applies offline RL to a gray-box approach to energy efficiency, combining online application-agnostic performance data (e.g., heartbeats) and hardware performance counters to ensure that the scientific objectives are met with limited performance degradation. Evaluating our method on a variety of compute-bound and memory-bound benchmarks and controlling power on a live system through Intel's Running Average Power Limit, we demonstrate that such an offline-trained agent can substantially reduce energy consumption at a tolerable performance degradation cost.",

As systems evolve toward automation, models must operate on edge devices (e.g., PLCs, microcontrollers) with strict constraints on latency and memory, limiting parameters to a few thousand. Conventional deep architectures are often impractical here. We propose the Fourier-Efficient Adaptive Temporal Hierarchy Forecaster (FEATHer) for accurate long-term forecasting under severe limits. FEATHer introduces: (i) ultra-lightweight multiscale decomposition into frequency pathways; (ii) a shared Dense Temporal Kernel using projection-depthwise convolution-projection without recurrence or attention; (iii) frequency-aware branch gating that adaptively fuses representations based on spectral characteristics; and (iv) a Sparse Period Kernel reconstructing outputs via period-wise downsampling to capture seasonality. FEATHer maintains a compact architecture (as few as 400 parameters) while outperforming baselines. Across eight benchmarks, it achieves the best ranking, recording 60 first-place results with an average rank of 2.05. These results demonstrate that reliable long-range forecasting is achievable on constrained edge hardware, offering a practical direction for industrial real-time inference.",

We develop a novel taxonomy of thematic elements in clinician responses and propose a novel evaluation framework for assessing clinician editing load of LLM-drafted responses at both content and theme levels. We release an expert-annotated dataset and conduct large-scale evaluations of local and commercial LLMs using various adaptation techniques including thematic prompting, retrieval-augmented generation, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference optimization. Our results reveal substantial epistemic uncertainty in aligning LLM drafts with clinician responses. While LLMs demonstrate capability in drafting certain thematic elements, they struggle with clinician-aligned generation in other themes, particularly question asking to elicit further information from patients.

      "abstract": "Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks. However, the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shows great successes for enhancing large language models (LLMs), has not been well explored, due to the fundamental difference between LLM and DLM decoding. To fill this critical gap, we systematically test the performance of DLMs within the RAG framework. Our findings reveal that DLMs coupled with RAG show promising potentials with stronger dependency on contextual information, but suffer from limited generation precision. We identify a key underlying issue: Response Semantic Drift (RSD), where the generated answer progressively deviates from the query's original semantics, leading to low precision content. We trace this problem to the denoising strategies in DLMs, which fail to maintain semantic alignment with the query throughout the iterative denoising process. To address this, we propose Semantic-Preserving REtrieval-Augmented Diffusion (SPREAD), a novel framework that introduces a query-relevance-guided denoising strategy. By actively guiding the denoising trajectory, SPREAD ensures the generation remains anchored to the query's semantics and effectively suppresses drift. Experimental results demonstrate that SPREAD significantly enhances the precision and effectively mitigates RSD of generated answers within the RAG framework.",

By quantitatively characterizing the solution space, we reveal the existence of sparse superior reasoning paths that are simultaneously more accurate and concise than standard outputs. Our method actively navigates towards these paths by evaluating candidate reasoning operators using a dual-factor heuristic that optimizes for both correctness and computational cost. Consequently, NCoTS achieves a Pareto improvement across diverse reasoning benchmarks, boosting accuracy by over 3.5% while reducing generation length by over 22%.

We present a simple, data-driven encoder-decoder architecture that learns cohort-specific stain characteristics for mIHC RGB WSIs and yields crisp, well-separated per-stain concentration maps. The encoder is a compact U-Net that predicts K nonnegative concentration channels; the decoder is a differentiable BL forward model with a learnable stain matrix initialized from typical chromogen hues. Training is unsupervised with a perceptual reconstruction objective augmented by loss terms that discourage unnecessary stain mixing. On a colorectal mIHC panel comprising 5 stains (H, CDX2, MUC2, MUC5, CD8) we show excellent RGB reconstruction, and significantly reduced inter-channel bleed-through compared with matrix-based deconvolution.

Beyond pass/fail metrics, we diagnose reasoning errors by comparing model-generated editorials to gold standards using expert annotations and validate an LLM-as-a-judge protocol for scalable evaluation.

Classical heuristics and constructive methods can generate packings quickly, but often fail to address industrial constraints such as stability, balance, and handling feasibility. Metaheuristics such as genetic algorithms (GAs) provide flexibility and the ability to optimize across multiple objectives; however, pure GA approaches frequently struggle with efficiency, parameter sensitivity, and scalability to industrial order sizes. This gap is especially evident when scaling to real-world pallet dimensions, where even state-of-the-art algorithms often fail to achieve robust, deployable solutions. We propose a KPI-driven GA-based pipeline for industrial 3D-BPP that integrates key performance indicators directly into a multi-objective fitness function. The methodology combines a layer-based chromosome representation with domain-specific operators and constructive heuristics to balance efficiency and feasibility. On the BED-BPP benchmark of 1,500 real-world orders, our Hybrid-GA pipeline consistently outperforms heuristic- and learning-based state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 35% higher space utilization and 15 to 20% stronger surface support, with lower variance across orders. These improvements come at a modest runtime cost but remain feasible for batch-scale deployment, yielding stable, balanced, and space-efficient packings.",

      "abstract": "Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) act as a crucial auditing tool for the opaque training data of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing techniques predominantly rely on inaccessible model internals (e.g., logits) or suffer from poor generalization across domains in strict black-box settings where only generated text is available. In this work, we propose SimMIA, a robust MIA framework tailored for this text-only regime by leveraging an advanced sampling strategy and scoring mechanism. Furthermore, we present WikiMIA-25, a new benchmark curated to evaluate MIA performance on modern proprietary LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that SimMIA achieves state-of-the-art results in the black-box setting, rivaling baselines that exploit internal model information.",

      "abstract": "Tabular data high-stakes critical decision-making in domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific discovery. Yet, learning effectively from tabular data in few-shot settings, where labeled examples are scarce, remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional tree-based methods often falter in these regimes due to their reliance on statistical purity metrics, which become unstable and prone to overfitting with limited supervision. At the same time, direct applications of large language models (LLMs) often overlook its inherent structure, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose FORESTLLM, a novel framework that unifies the structural inductive biases of decision forests with the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Crucially, FORESTLLM leverages the LLM only during training, treating it as an offline model designer that encodes rich, contextual knowledge into a lightweight, interpretable forest model, eliminating the need for LLM inference at test time. Our method is two-fold. First, we introduce a semantic splitting criterion in which the LLM evaluates candidate partitions based on their coherence over both labeled and unlabeled data, enabling the induction of more robust and generalizable tree structures under few-shot supervision. Second, we propose a one-time in-context inference mechanism for leaf node stabilization, where the LLM distills the decision path and its supporting examples into a concise, deterministic prediction, replacing noisy empirical estimates with semantically informed outputs. Across a diverse suite of few-shot classification and regression benchmarks, FORESTLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

      "abstract": "Semantic ultra high resolution image (UHR) segmentation is essential in remote sensing applications such as aerial mapping and environmental monitoring. Transformer-based models struggle in this setting because memory grows quadratically with token count, constraining either the contextual scope or the spatial resolution. We introduce CASWiT (Context-Aware Stage-Wise Transformer), a dual-branch, Swin-based architecture that injects global cues into fine-grained UHR features. A context encoder processes a downsampled neighborhood to capture long-range dependencies, while a high resolution encoder extracts detailed features from UHR patches. A cross-scale fusion module, combining cross-attention and gated feature injection, enriches high-resolution tokens with context. Beyond architecture, we propose a SimMIM-style pretraining. We mask 75% of the high-resolution image tokens and the low-resolution center region that spatially corresponds to the UHR patch, then train the shared dual-encoder with small decoder to reconstruct the UHR initial image. Extensive experiments on the large-scale IGN FLAIR-HUB aerial dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of CASWiT. Our method achieves 65.83% mIoU, outperforming RGB baselines by 1.78 points.

We present SAMannot, an open-source, local framework that integrates the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) into a human-in-the-loop workflow. To address the high resource requirements of foundation models, we modified the SAM2 dependency and implemented a processing layer that minimizes computational overhead and maximizes throughput, ensuring a highly responsive user interface.

While large proprietary models achieve strong performance, their closed weights, complexity, and high costs limit sustainability.

We propose \\textbf{multi-task learning (MTL)} as a more efficient alternative that fine-tunes a single model to perform claim detection, evidence ranking, and stance detection jointly. Using small decoder-only LLMs (e.g., Qwen3-4b), we explore three MTL strategies: classification heads, causal language modeling heads, and instruction-tuning, and evaluate them across model sizes, task orders, and standard non-LLM baselines. While multitask models do not universally surpass single-task baselines, they yield substantial improvements, achieving up to \\textbf{44\\%}, \\textbf{54\\%}, and \\textbf{31\\%} relative gains for claim detection, evidence re-ranking, and stance detection, respectively, over zero-/few-shot settings.

      "abstract": "Effective disaster response relies on rapid disaster response, where oblique aerial video is the primary modality for initial scouting due to its ability to maximize spatial coverage and situational awareness in limited flight time. However, the on-board processing of high-resolution oblique streams is severely bottlenecked by the strict Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constraints of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The computational density required to process these wide-field-of-view streams precludes low-latency inference on standard edge hardware. To address this, we propose Temporal Token Reuse (TTR), an adaptive inference framework capable of accelerating video segmentation on embedded devices. TTR exploits the intrinsic spatiotemporal redundancy of aerial video by formulating image patches as tokens; it utilizes a lightweight similarity metric to dynamically identify static regions and propagate their precomputed deep features, thereby bypassing redundant backbone computations. We validate the framework on standard benchmarks and a newly curated Oblique Floodwater Dataset designed for hydrological monitoring. Experimental results on edge-grade hardware demonstrate that TTR achieves a 30% reduction in inference latency with negligible degradation in segmentation accuracy (< 0.5% mIoU). These findings confirm that TTR effectively shifts the operational Pareto frontier, enabling high-fidelity, real-time oblique video understanding for time-critical remote sensing missions",

Addressing this need, we aim to understand how information mediums of present-day SERPs and AI-generated podcasts interact to shape the opinions of users. To this end, through a controlled user study (N=483), we investigated user attitudinal effects of consuming information via SERPs and AI-generated podcasts, focusing on how the sequence and modality of exposure shape user opinions. A majority of users in our study corresponded to attitude change outcomes, and we found an effect of sequence on attitude change.

Our approach involves an offline, cross-architecture knowledge distillation, transferring the rich visual representations of a large, frozen DINOv2 teacher to a compact ResNet-18 student on the general-purpose ImageNet dataset. This distilled encoder, now endowed with powerful visual priors, is then jointly fine-tuned with a diffusion policy head on the target manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on $34$ simulated benchmarks and $5$ challenging real-world tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms policies equipped with from-scratch ResNet or fine-tuned DINOv2 encoders.

While effective, these methods demand substantial training time and computational resources. By contrast, lyrics constitute a strong invariant across covers, though their use has been limited by the difficulty of extracting them accurately and efficiently from polyphonic audio. Early methods relied on simple frameworks that limited downstream performance, while more recent systems deliver stronger results but require large models integrated within complex multimodal architectures. We introduce LIVI (Lyrics-Informed Version Identification), an approach that seeks to balance retrieval accuracy with computational efficiency.

      "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are emerging as powerful tools for nonlinear Model Order Reduction (MOR) of time-dependent parameterized Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, existing methodologies struggle to combine geometric inductive biases with interpretable latent behavior, overlooking dynamics-driven features or disregarding spatial information. In this work, we address this gap by introducing Latent Dynamics Graph Convolutional Network (LD-GCN), a purely data-driven, encoder-free architecture that learns a global, low-dimensional representation of dynamical systems conditioned on external inputs and parameters. The temporal evolution is modeled in the latent space and advanced through time-stepping, allowing for time-extrapolation, and the trajectories are consistently decoded onto geometrically parameterized domains using a GNN. Our framework enhances interpretability by enabling the analysis of the reduced dynamics and supporting zero-shot prediction through latent interpolation. The methodology is mathematically validated via a universal approximation theorem for encoder-free architectures, and numerically tested on complex computational mechanics problems involving physical and geometric parameters, including the detection of bifurcating phenomena for Navier-Stokes equations.

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) face the \"knowledge cutoff\" challenge, where their frozen parametric memory prevents direct internalization of new information. While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is commonly used to update model knowledge, it often updates factual content without reliably improving the model's ability to use the newly incorporated information for question answering or decision-making. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is essential for acquiring reasoning skills; however, its high computational cost makes it impractical for efficient online adaptation. We empirically observe that the parameter updates induced by SFT and RL are nearly orthogonal. Based on this observation, we propose Parametric Skill Transfer (PaST), a framework that supports modular skill transfer for efficient and effective knowledge adaptation. By extracting a domain-agnostic Skill Vector from a source domain, we can linearly inject knowledge manipulation skills into a target model after it has undergone lightweight SFT on new data. Experiments on knowledge-incorporation QA (SQuAD, LooGLE) and agentic tool-use benchmarks (ToolBench) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On SQuAD, PaST outperforms the state-of-the-art self-editing SFT baseline by up to 9.9 points. PaST further scales to long-context QA on LooGLE with an 8.0-point absolute accuracy gain, and improves zero-shot ToolBench success rates by +10.3 points on average with consistent gains across tool categories, indicating strong scalability and cross-domain transferability of the Skill Vector.",

To address these issues, we introduce Reasoning Tree Guided RAG (RT-RAG), a novel hierarchical framework for complex multi-hop QA. RT-RAG systematically decomposes multi-hop questions into explicit reasoning trees, minimizing inaccurate decomposition through structured entity analysis and consensus-based tree selection that clearly separates core queries, known entities, and unknown entities. Subsequently, a bottom-up traversal strategy employs iterative query rewriting and refinement to collect high-quality evidence, thereby mitigating error propagation.

      "abstract": "Recent advances in video anomaly detection (VAD) mainly focus on ground-based surveillance or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) videos with static backgrounds, whereas research on UAV videos with dynamic backgrounds remains limited. Unlike static scenarios, dynamically captured UAV videos exhibit multi-source motion coupling, where the motion of objects and UAV-induced global motion are intricately intertwined. Consequently, existing methods may misclassify normal UAV movements as anomalies or fail to capture true anomalies concealed within dynamic backgrounds. Moreover, many approaches do not adequately address the joint modeling of inter-frame continuity and local spatial correlations across diverse temporal scales. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Frequency-Assisted Temporal Dilation Mamba (FTDMamba) network for UAV VAD, including two core components: (1) a Frequency Decoupled Spatiotemporal Correlation Module, which disentangles coupled motion patterns and models global spatiotemporal dependencies through frequency analysis; and (2) a Temporal Dilation Mamba Module, which leverages Mamba's sequence modeling capability to jointly learn fine-grained temporal dynamics and local spatial structures across multiple temporal receptive fields. Additionally, unlike existing UAV VAD datasets which focus on static backgrounds, we construct a large-scale Moving UAV VAD dataset (MUVAD), comprising 222,736 frames with 240 anomaly events across 12 anomaly types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FTDMamba achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two public static benchmarks and the new MUVAD dataset.

Existing efficient reasoning methods operate in a closed-loop manner, lacking mechanisms for external intervention to guide the reasoning process. To address this, we propose Think-with-Me, a novel test-time interactive reasoning paradigm that introduces external feedback intervention into the reasoning process. Our key insights are that transitional conjunctions serve as natural points for intervention, signaling phases of self-validation or exploration and using transitional words appropriately to prolong the reasoning enhances performance, while excessive use affects performance. Building on these insights, Think-with-Me pauses reasoning at these points for external feedback, adaptively extending or terminating reasoning to reduce redundancy while preserving accuracy. The feedback is generated via a multi-criteria evaluation (rationality and completeness) and comes from either human or LLM proxies. We train the target model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to adapt to this interactive mode. Experiments show that Think-with-Me achieves a superior balance between accuracy and reasoning length under limited context windows. On AIME24, Think-with-Me outperforms QwQ-32B by 7.19% in accuracy while reducing average reasoning length by 81% under an 8K window. The paradigm also benefits security and creative tasks.",

We start with a pre-trained CLIP model with an image encoder and a text encoder. In Stage I, we introduce a scenario embedding in the image encoder and fine-tune the encoder to adaptively leverage knowledge from multiple scenarios. In Stage II, we optimize a set of learned text embeddings to associate with pseudo-labels from Stage I and introduce a multi-scenario separation loss to increase the divergence between inter-scenario text representations. In Stage III, we first introduce cluster-level and instance-level heterogeneous matching modules to obtain reliable heterogeneous positive pairs (e.g., a visible image and an infrared image of the same person) within each scenario. Next, we propose a dynamic text representation update strategy to maintain consistency between text and image supervision signals. Experimental results across multiple scenarios demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of ITKM; it not only outperforms existing scenario-specific methods but also enhances overall performance by integrating knowledge from multiple scenarios.",

We refer to this approach as the Mathematical Artificial Data Boundary Neural Operator (MAD-BNO), which learns boundary-to-boundary mappings using MAD-generated Dirichlet-Neumann data pairs. Once trained, the interior solution at arbitrary locations can be efficiently recovered through boundary integral formulations, supporting Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions as well as general source terms. The proposed method is validated on benchmark operator learning tasks for two-dimensional Laplace, Poisson, and Helmholtz equations, where it achieves accuracy comparable to or better than existing neural operator approaches while significantly reducing training time.

Pairs of claims referring to the same image or video were labeled through multiple strategies to determine whether they contradict each other. The resulting dataset comprises 11,088 visual claims in 64 languages, offering a unique resource for building and evaluating misinformation-detection systems in truly multimodal and multilingual environments. We then provide comprehensive experiments using transformer-based architectures, natural language inference models, and large language models, establishing strong baselines for future research.

Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA are widely adopted to reduce communication and memory costs. Despite these advances, practical FL deployments often exhibit rank heterogeneity, since different clients may use different low-rank configurations. This makes direct aggregation of LoRA updates biased and unstable. Existing solutions typically enforce unified ranks or align heterogeneous updates into a shared subspace, which over-constrains client-specific semantics, limits personalization, and provides weak protection of local client information under differential privacy noise. To address this issue, we propose Selective Dual-module Federated LoRA (SDFLoRA), which decomposes each client adapter into a global module that captures transferable knowledge and a local module that preserves client-specific adaptations. The global module is selectively aligned and aggregated across clients, while local modules remain private. This design enables robust learning under rank heterogeneity and supports privacy-aware optimization by injecting differential privacy noise exclusively into the global module. Experiments on GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that SDFLoRA outperforms representative federated LoRA baselines and achieves a better utility-privacy trade-off.",

      "abstract": "We study model-free policy learning for discrete-time mean-field control (MFC) problems with finite state space and compact action space. In contrast to the extensive literature on value-based methods for MFC, policy-based approaches remain largely unexplored due to the intrinsic dependence of transition kernels and rewards on the evolving population state distribution, which prevents the direct use of likelihood-ratio estimators of policy gradients from classical single-agent reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel perturbation scheme on the state-distribution flow and prove that the gradient of the resulting perturbed value function converges to the true policy gradient as the perturbation magnitude vanishes. This construction yields a fully model-free estimator based solely on simulated trajectories and an auxiliary estimate of the sensitivity of the state distribution. Building on this framework, we develop MF-REINFORCE, a model-free policy gradient algorithm for MFC, and establish explicit quantitative bounds on its bias and mean-squared error. Numerical experiments on representative mean-field control tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "The proliferation of powerful Text-to-Video (T2V) models, trained on massive web-scale datasets, raises urgent concerns about copyright and privacy violations. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) provide a principled tool for auditing such risks, yet existing techniques - designed for static data like images or text - fail to capture the spatio-temporal complexities of video generation. In particular, they overlook the sparsity of memorization signals in keyframes and the instability introduced by stochastic temporal dynamics. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study of MIAs against T2V models and introduce a novel framework VidLeaks, which probes sparse-temporal memorization through two complementary signals: 1) Spatial Reconstruction Fidelity (SRF), using a Top-K similarity to amplify spatial memorization signals from sparsely memorized keyframes, and 2) Temporal Generative Stability (TGS), which measures semantic consistency across multiple queries to capture temporal leakage. We evaluate VidLeaks under three progressively restrictive black-box settings - supervised, reference-based, and query-only. Experiments on three representative T2V models reveal severe vulnerabilities: VidLeaks achieves AUC of 82.92% on AnimateDiff and 97.01% on InstructVideo even in the strict query-only setting, posing a realistic and exploitable privacy risk. Our work provides the first concrete evidence that T2V models leak substantial membership information through both sparse and temporal memorization, establishing a foundation for auditing video generation systems and motivating the development of new defenses.

Traditional PTQ methods typically rely on limited samples, making it difficult to capture the activation distribution during the inference phase, leading to biases in quantization parameters. To address this, we propose \\textbf{FAQ} (Family-Aware Quantization), a calibration data regeneration framework that leverages prior knowledge from LLMs of the same family to generate high-fidelity calibration samples. Specifically, FAQ first inputs the original calibration samples into a larger LLM from the same family as the target model, regenerating a series of high-fidelity calibration data using a highly consistent knowledge system. Subsequently, this data, carrying Chain-of-Thought reasoning and conforming to the expected activation distribution, undergoes group competition under expert guidance to select the best samples, which are then re-normalized to enhance the effectiveness of standard PTQ. Experiments on multiple model series, including Qwen3-8B, show that FAQ reduces accuracy loss by up to 28.5\\% compared to the baseline with original calibration data, demonstrating its powerful potential and contribution.",

      "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has attracted significant attention due to its ability to combine the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with knowledge obtained through efficient retrieval mechanisms over large-scale data collections. Currently, the majority of existing approaches overlook the risks associated with exposing sensitive or access-controlled information directly to the generation model. Only a few approaches propose techniques to instruct the generative model to refrain from disclosing sensitive information; however, recent studies have also demonstrated that LLMs remain vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that can override intended behavioral constraints. For these reasons, we propose a novel approach to Selective Disclosure in Retrieval-Augmented Generation, called SD-RAG, which decouples the enforcement of security and privacy constraints from the generation process itself. Rather than relying on prompt-level safeguards, SD-RAG applies sanitization and disclosure controls during the retrieval phase, prior to augmenting the language model's input. Moreover, we introduce a semantic mechanism to allow the ingestion of human-readable dynamic security and privacy constraints together with an optimized graph-based data model that supports fine-grained, policy-aware retrieval. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the superiority of SD-RAG over baseline existing approaches, achieving up to a $58\\%$ improvement in the privacy score, while also showing a strong resilience to prompt injection attacks targeting the generative model.",

We highlight the crucial role played by data centers, which constitute the backbone of the AI ecosystem and have attracted formidable investment in 2025, as they are indispensable for meeting the rapidly increasing worldwide demand for AI services. We document that the boom in IT and AI-related capital expenditure in the first three quarters of the year has given an outsized boost to aggregate demand, while its contribution to GDP growth is smaller once the high import content of AI hardware is netted out. Furthermore, simple calculations suggest that, at current utilization rates and pricing, the production of services originating in new AI data centers could contribute to GDP over the turn of the next quarters on a scale comparable to that of investment spending to date. Short reinvestment cycles and uncertainty about future AI demand, while not currently acting as a macroeconomic drag, can nevertheless fuel macroeconomic risks over the medium term.",

By contrast, our suggested approach relies on the joint transport of a segment in the sample space, yielding faster computation at inference time. Our approach can be built on top of an arbitrary Rectified Flow model operating on the structured latent space. We show the applicability of our method to the domains of image, video, and 3D shape generation using state-of-the-art baselines and evaluate it against both editing-based and joint inference-based competing approaches. We demonstrate a high degree of structural alignment for the sample pairs obtained with our method and a high visual quality of the samples.

First, action prefiltering restricts decision-making to feasible low-level actions, enabling low-level heuristics to be evaluated independently of environmental constraints and providing an unbiased assessment. Second, a commitment mechanism regulates the frequency of heuristic switching. We investigate the impact of different commitment strategies, from step-wise switching to full-episode commitment, on both training behavior and makespan. Additionally, we compare two action selection strategies at the policy level: deterministic greedy selection and stochastic sampling. Computational experiments on standard JSSP benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional heuristics, metaheuristics, and recent neural network-based scheduling methods",

Our approach encodes sequences into discrete tokens at multiple temporal resolutions and performs autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine manner, thereby preserving hierarchical dependencies. To tackle structural heterogeneity, we introduce a dual-path VQ-VAE that disentangles trend and seasonal components, enabling the learning of semantically consistent latent representations. Additionally, we present a guidance-based reconstruction strategy, where coarse seasonal signals are utilized as priors to guide the reconstruction of fine-grained seasonal patterns.

However, the immense computational and storage requirements for global-scale analysis often preclude widespread use, hindering planetary-scale studies. To address these barriers, we present Embedded Seamless Data (ESD), an ultra-lightweight, 30-m global Earth embedding database spanning the 25-year period from 2000 to 2024. By transforming high-dimensional, multi-sensor observations from the Landsat series (5, 7, 8, and 9) and MODIS Terra into information-dense, quantized latent vectors, ESD distills essential geophysical and semantic features into a unified latent space. Utilizing the ESDNet architecture and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ), the dataset achieves a transformative ~340-fold reduction in data volume compared to raw archives. This compression allows the entire global land surface for a single year to be encapsulated within approximately 2.4 TB, enabling decadal-scale global analysis on standard local workstations. Rigorous validation demonstrates high reconstructive fidelity (MAE: 0.0130; RMSE: 0.0179; CC: 0.8543). By condensing the annual phenological cycle into 12 temporal steps, the embeddings provide inherent denoising and a semantically organized space that outperforms raw reflectance in land-cover classification, achieving 79.74% accuracy (vs. 76.92% for raw fusion). With robust few-shot learning capabilities and longitudinal consistency, ESD provides a versatile foundation for democratizing planetary-scale research and advancing next-generation geospatial artificial intelligence.",

      "abstract": "Social media platforms are increasingly dominated by long-form multimodal content, where harmful narratives are constructed through a complex interplay of audio, visual, and textual cues. While automated systems can flag hate speech with high accuracy, they often function as \"black boxes\" that fail to provide the granular, interpretable evidence, such as precise timestamps and target identities, required for effective human-in-the-loop moderation. In this work, we introduce TANDEM, a unified framework that transforms audio-visual hate detection from a binary classification task into a structured reasoning problem. Our approach employs a novel tandem reinforcement learning strategy where vision-language and audio-language models optimize each other through self-constrained cross-modal context, stabilizing reasoning over extended temporal sequences without requiring dense frame-level supervision. Experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that TANDEM significantly outperforms zero-shot and context-augmented baselines, achieving 0.73 F1 in target identification on HateMM (a 30% improvement over state-of-the-art) while maintaining precise temporal grounding. We further observe that while binary detection is robust, differentiating between offensive and hateful content remains challenging in multi-class settings due to inherent label ambiguity and dataset imbalance. More broadly, our findings suggest that structured, interpretable alignment is achievable even in complex multimodal settings, offering a blueprint for the next generation of transparent and actionable online safety moderation tools.",

This approach has been recently used for South Slavic languages and resulted in the largest general corpora for this language group: the CLASSLA-web 1.0 corpora. Building on this success, we established a continuous crawling infrastructure for iterative national top-level domain crawling across South Slavic and related webs. We present the first outcome of this crawling infrastructure - the CLASSLA-web 2.0 corpus collection, with substantially larger web corpora containing 17.0 billion words in 38.1 million texts in seven languages: Bosnian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Serbian, and Slovenian. In addition to genre categories, the new version is also automatically annotated with topic labels. Comparing CLASSLA-web 2.0 with its predecessor reveals that only one-fifth of the texts overlap, showing that re-crawling after just two years yields largely new content. However, while the new web crawls bring growing gains, we also notice growing pains - a manual inspection of top domains reveals a visible degradation of web content, as machine-generated sites now contribute a significant portion of texts.",

Linear attention reduces the cost to O(N), yet its compressed state representations can impair modeling capacity and accuracy. We present an analytical study that contrasts linear and softmax attention for visual representation learning from a layer-stacking perspective. We further conduct systematic experiments on layer-wise hybridization patterns of linear and softmax attention. Our results show that, compared with rigid intra-block hybrid designs, fine-grained layer-wise hybridization can match or surpass performance while requiring fewer softmax layers. Building on these findings, we propose SoLA-Vision (Softmax-Linear Attention Vision), a flexible layer-wise hybrid attention backbone that enables fine-grained control over how linear and softmax attention are integrated. By strategically inserting a small number of global softmax layers, SoLA-Vision achieves a strong trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. On ImageNet-1K, SoLA-Vision outperforms purely linear and other hybrid attention models. On dense prediction tasks, it consistently surpasses strong baselines by a considerable margin.

Thereby, in realistic scenarios, the source data may no longer be available during adaptation, and the label space of the target domain may differ from the source label space. This setting, known as source-free universal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA), has recently gained attention, but all existing approaches only assume a single domain shift from source to target. In this work, we present the first study on continual SF-UniDA, where the model must adapt sequentially to a stream of multiple different unlabeled target domains. Building upon our previous methods for online SF-UniDA, we combine their key ideas by integrating Gaussian mixture model-based pseudo-labeling within a mean teacher framework for improved stability over long adaptation sequences. Additionally, we introduce consistency losses for further robustness. The resulting method GMM-COMET provides a strong first baseline for continual SF-UniDA and is the only approach in our experiments to consistently improve upon the source-only model across all evaluated scenarios.

      "abstract": "How to find a natural grouping of a large real data set? Clustering requires a balance between abstraction and representation. To identify clusters, we need to abstract from superfluous details of individual objects. But we also need a rich representation that emphasizes the key features shared by groups of objects that distinguish them from other groups of objects.\n  Each clustering algorithm implements a different trade-off between abstraction and representation. Classical K-means implements a high level of abstraction - details are simply averaged out - combined with a very simple representation - all clusters are Gaussians in the original data space. We will see how approaches to subspace and deep clustering support high-dimensional and complex data by allowing richer representations. However, with increasing representational expressiveness comes the need to explicitly enforce abstraction in the objective function to ensure that the resulting method performs clustering and not just representation learning. We will see how current deep clustering methods define and enforce abstraction through centroid-based and density-based clustering losses. Balancing the conflicting goals of abstraction and representation is challenging. Ideas from subspace clustering help by learning one latent space for the information that is relevant to clustering and another latent space to capture all other information in the data.\n  The tutorial ends with an outlook on future research in clustering. Future methods will more adaptively balance abstraction and representation to improve performance, energy efficiency and interpretability. By automatically finding the sweet spot between abstraction and representation, the human brain is very good at clustering and other related tasks such as single-shot learning. So, there is still much room for improvement.",

      "abstract": "The computation of resistance distance is pivotal in a wide range of graph analysis applications, including graph clustering, link prediction, and graph neural networks. Despite its foundational importance, efficient algorithms for computing resistance distances on large graphs are still lacking. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including power iteration-based algorithms and random walk-based local approaches, often struggle with slow convergence rates, particularly when the condition number of the graph Laplacian matrix, denoted by $κ$, is large. To tackle this challenge, we propose two novel and efficient algorithms inspired by the classic Lanczos method: Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push, both designed to reduce dependence on $κ$. Among them, Lanczos Iteration is a near-linear time global algorithm, whereas Lanczos Push is a local algorithm with a time complexity independent of the size of the graph. More specifically, we prove that the time complexity of Lanczos Iteration is $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrtκ m)$ ($m$ is the number of edges of the graph and $\\tilde{O}$ means the complexity omitting the $\\log$ terms) which achieves a speedup of $\\sqrtκ$ compared to previous power iteration-based global methods. For Lanczos Push, we demonstrate that its time complexity is $\\tilde{O}(κ^{2.75})$ under certain mild and frequently established assumptions, which represents a significant improvement of $κ^{0.25}$ over the SOTA random walk-based local algorithms. We validate our algorithms through extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets of varying sizes and statistical properties, demonstrating that Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push significantly outperform SOTA methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.",

To mitigate these risks, this study compares two predictive maintenance strategies for helicopter engines: a supervised classification pipeline and an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on autoencoders (AEs).

Both methods are evaluated on a real-world dataset comprising labelled snapshots of helicopter engine telemetry. While supervised models demonstrate strong performance when annotated failures are available, the AE achieves effective detection without requiring fault labels, making it particularly well suited for settings where failure data are scarce or incomplete.

Despite notable advancements, existing approaches still face two critical limitations: first, shallow modality fusion often relies on simple concatenation, failing to exploit rich synergic intra- and inter-modal relationships; second, asymmetric feature treatment-where users are only characterized by interaction IDs while items benefit from rich multimodal content-hinders the learning of a shared semantic space. To address these issues, we propose a Cross-modal Recursive Attention Network with dual graph Embedding (CRANE). To tackle shallow fusion, we design a core Recursive Cross-Modal Attention (RCA) mechanism that iteratively refines modality features based on cross-correlations in a joint latent space, effectively capturing high-order intra- and inter-modal dependencies. For symmetric multimodal learning, we explicitly construct users' multimodal profiles by aggregating features of their interacted items. Furthermore, CRANE integrates a symmetric dual-graph framework-comprising a heterogeneous user-item interaction graph and a homogeneous item-item semantic graph-unified by a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to fuse behavioral and semantic signals. Despite these complex modeling capabilities, CRANE maintains high computational efficiency. Theoretical and empirical analyses confirm its scalability and high practical efficiency, achieving faster convergence on small datasets and superior performance ceilings on large-scale ones. Comprehensive experiments on four public real-world datasets validate an average 5% improvement in key metrics over state-of-the-art baselines.",

Existing methods are often challenged by navigating large-scale hierarchical graphs, optimizing retrieval paths, and balancing exploration-exploitation dynamics, frequently lacking robust multi-stage re-ranking. To overcome these deficits, we propose Deep GraphRAG, a framework designed for a balanced approach to hierarchical retrieval and adaptive integration. It introduces a hierarchical global-to-local retrieval strategy that integrates macroscopic inter-community and microscopic intra-community contextual relations. This strategy employs a three-stage process: (1) inter-community filtering, which prunes the search space using local context; (2) community-level refinement, which prioritizes relevant subgraphs via entity-interaction analysis; and (3) entity-level fine-grained search within target communities. A beam search-optimized dynamic re-ranking module guides this process, continuously filtering candidates to balance efficiency and global comprehensiveness. Deep GraphRAG also features a Knowledge Integration Module leveraging a compact LLM, trained with Dynamic Weighting Reward GRPO (DW-GRPO). This novel reinforcement learning approach dynamically adjusts reward weights to balance three key objectives: relevance, faithfulness, and conciseness. This training enables compact models (1.5B) to approach the performance of large models (70B) in the integration task. Evaluations on Natural Questions and HotpotQA demonstrate that Deep GraphRAG significantly outperforms baseline graph retrieval methods in both accuracy and efficiency.",

In this work, we present Chroma 1.0, the first open-source, real-time, end-to-end spoken dialogue model that achieves both low-latency interaction and high-fidelity personalized voice cloning. Chroma achieves sub-second end-to-end latency through an interleaved text-audio token schedule (1:2) that supports streaming generation, while maintaining high-quality personalized voice synthesis across multi-turn conversations. Our experimental results demonstrate that Chroma achieves a 10.96% relative improvement in speaker similarity over the human baseline, with a Real-Time Factor (RTF) of 0.43, while maintaining strong reasoning and dialogue capabilities.

      "abstract": "Molecular property prediction is becoming one of the major applications of graph learning in Web-based services, e.g., online protein structure prediction and drug discovery. A key challenge arises in few-shot scenarios, where only a few labeled molecules are available for predicting unseen properties. Recently, several studies have used in-context learning to capture relationships among molecules and properties, but they face two limitations in: (1) exploiting prior knowledge of functional groups that are causally linked to properties and (2) identifying key substructures directly correlated with properties. We propose CaMol, a context-aware graph causality inference framework, to address these challenges by using a causal inference perspective, assuming that each molecule consists of a latent causal structure that determines a specific property. First, we introduce a context graph that encodes chemical knowledge by linking functional groups, molecules, and properties to guide the discovery of causal substructures. Second, we propose a learnable atom masking strategy to disentangle causal substructures from confounding ones. Third, we introduce a distribution intervener that applies backdoor adjustment by combining causal substructures with chemically grounded confounders, disentangling causal effects from real-world chemical variations. Experiments on diverse molecular datasets showed that CaMol achieved superior accuracy and sample efficiency in few-shot tasks, showing its generalizability to unseen properties. Also, the discovered causal substructures were strongly aligned with chemical knowledge about functional groups, supporting the model interpretability.",

      "abstract": "Credit risk models are a critical decision-support tool for financial institutions, yet tightening data-protection rules (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) increasingly prohibit cross-border sharing of borrower data, even as these models benefit from cross-institution learning. Traditional default prediction suffers from two limitations: binary classification ignores default timing, treating early defaulters (high loss) equivalently to late defaulters (low loss), and centralized training violates emerging regulatory constraints. We propose a Federated Survival Learning framework with Bayesian Differential Privacy (FSL-BDP) that models time-to-default trajectories without centralizing sensitive data. The framework provides Bayesian (data-dependent) differential privacy (DP) guarantees while enabling institutions to jointly learn risk dynamics. Experiments on three real-world credit datasets (LendingClub, SBA, Bondora) show that federation fundamentally alters the relative effectiveness of privacy mechanisms. While classical DP performs better than Bayesian DP in centralized settings, the latter benefits substantially more from federation (+7.0\\% vs +1.4\\%), achieving near parity of non-private performance and outperforming classical DP in the majority of participating clients. This ranking reversal yields a key decision-support insight: privacy mechanism selection should be evaluated in the target deployment architecture, rather than centralized benchmarks. These findings provide actionable guidance for practitioners designing privacy-preserving decision support systems in regulated, multi-institutional environments.",

Combining S2NO with evolutionary algorithms enables voxel-level optimisation of material distributions for shape morphing programming on various complex geometries, including irregular-boundary shapes, porous structures, and thin-walled structures.

To bridge this gap, we propose Learn Before Represent (LBR), a novel two-stage framework. LBR first injects domain knowledge via an Information Bottleneck-Constrained Generative Learning stage, preserving the LLM's causal attention to maximize knowledge acquisition while compressing semantics. It then performs Generative-Refined Contrastive Learning on the compressed representations for alignment. This approach maintains architectural consistency and resolves the objective conflict between generative and contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on medical, chemistry, and code retrieval tasks show that LBR significantly outperforms strong baselines.

To improve clustering accuracy, many researchers have incorporated background knowledge, typically in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, to guide the clustering process. With the recent advent of large language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in improving clustering quality through LLM-based automatic constraint generation. In this paper, we propose a novel constraint-generation approach that reduces resource consumption by generating constraint sets rather than using traditional pairwise constraints. This approach improves both query efficiency and constraint accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. We further introduce a constrained clustering algorithm tailored to the characteristics of LLM-generated constraints. Our method incorporates a confidence threshold and a penalty mechanism to address potentially inaccurate constraints. We evaluate our approach on five text datasets, considering both the cost of constraint generation and the overall clustering performance. The results show that our method achieves clustering accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithms while reducing the number of LLM queries by more than 20 times.",

Although standard DMD widely used for uncovering spatio-temporal patterns and constructing low-dimensional models of dynamical systems, it suffers from significant performance degradation under noise due to its reliance on least-squares estimation for computing the linear time evolution operator. Existing robust variants typically modify the least-squares formulation, but they remain unstable and fail to ensure faithful low-dimensional representations. First, we introduce a convex optimization-based preprocessing method designed to effectively remove mixed noise, achieving accurate and stable mode extraction. Second, we propose a new convex formulation for dimensional reduction that explicitly links the robustly extracted modes to the original noisy observations, constructing a faithful representation of the original data via a sparse weighted sum of the modes. Both stages are efficiently solved by a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method. Experiments on fluid dynamics datasets demonstrate that CR-DMD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art robust DMD methods in terms of mode accuracy and fidelity of low-dimensional representations under noisy conditions.",

Differential privacy (DP) offers rigorous privacy guarantees and has been widely adopted in fine-tuning; however, naively injecting noise across the high-dimensional parameter space creates perturbations with large norms, degrading performance and destabilizing training. To address this issue, we propose DP-SFT, a two-stage subspace fine-tuning method that substantially reduces noise magnitude while preserving formal DP guarantees. Our intuition is that, during fine-tuning, significant parameter updates lie within a low-dimensional, task-specific subspace, while other directions change minimally. Hence, we only inject DP noise into this subspace to protect privacy without perturbing irrelevant parameters. In phase one, we identify the subspace by analyzing principal gradient directions to capture task-specific update signals. In phase two, we project full gradients onto this subspace, add DP noise, and map the perturbed gradients back to the original parameter space for model updates, markedly lowering noise impact. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DP-SFT enhances accuracy and stability under rigorous DP constraints, accelerates convergence, and achieves substantial gains over DP fine-tuning baselines.",

Stemming from this, we present VIGA (Vision-as-Inverse-Graphic Agent) that starts from an empty world and reconstructs or edits scenes through a closed-loop write-run-render-compare-revise procedure. To support long-horizon reasoning, VIGA combines (i) a skill library that alternates generator and verifier roles and (ii) an evolving context memory that contains plans, code diffs, and render history. VIGA is task-agnostic as it doesn't require auxiliary modules, covering a wide range of tasks such as 3D reconstruction, multi-step scene editing, 4D physical interaction, and 2D document editing, etc. Empirically, we found VIGA substantially improves one-shot baselines on BlenderGym (35.32%) and SlideBench (117.17%). Moreover, VIGA is also model-agnostic as it doesn't require finetuning, enabling a unified protocol to evaluate heterogeneous foundation VLMs. To better support this protocol, we introduce BlenderBench, a challenging benchmark that stress-tests interleaved multimodal reasoning with graphics engine, where VIGA improves by 124.70%.",

Such strategies overlook critical evidence explaining why an agent succeeds or fails, and often require high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose ReCreate, an experience-driven framework for the automatic creation of domain agents. ReCreate systematically leverages agent interaction histories, which provide rich concrete signals on both the causes of success or failure and the avenues for improvement. Specifically, we introduce an agent-as-optimizer paradigm that effectively learns from experience via three key components: (i) an experience storage and retrieval mechanism for on-demand inspection; (ii) a reasoning-creating synergy pipeline that maps execution experience into scaffold edits; and (iii) hierarchical updates that abstract instance-level details into reusable domain patterns.

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can now solve entire exams directly from uploaded PDF assessments, raising urgent concerns about academic integrity and the reliability of grades and credentials. Existing watermarking techniques either operate at the token level or assume control over the model's decoding process, making them ineffective when students query proprietary black-box systems with instructor-provided documents. We present Integrity Shield, a document-layer watermarking system that embeds schema-aware, item-level watermarks into assessment PDFs while keeping their human-visible appearance unchanged. These watermarks consistently prevent MLLMs from answering shielded exam PDFs and encode stable, item-level signatures that can be reliably recovered from model or student responses. Across 30 exams spanning STEM, humanities, and medical reasoning, Integrity Shield achieves exceptionally high prevention (91-94% exam-level blocking) and strong detection reliability (89-93% signature retrieval) across four commercial MLLMs. Our demo showcases an interactive interface where instructors upload an exam, preview watermark behavior, and inspect pre/post AI performance & authorship evidence.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a distributed framework for reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional, large-scale, heterogeneous matrix-variate time series data using a factor model. The data are first partitioned column-wise (or row-wise) and allocated to node servers, where each node estimates the row (or column) loading matrix via two-dimensional tensor PCA. These local estimates are then transmitted to a central server and aggregated, followed by a final PCA step to obtain the global row (or column) loading matrix estimator. Given the estimated loading matrices, the corresponding factor matrices are subsequently computed. Unlike existing distributed approaches, our framework preserves the latent matrix structure, thereby improving computational efficiency and enhancing information utilization. We also discuss row- and column-wise clustering procedures for settings in which the group memberships are unknown. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to unit-root nonstationary matrix-variate time series. Asymptotic properties of the proposed method are derived for the diverging dimension of the data in each computing unit and the sample size $T$. Simulation results assess the computational efficiency and estimation accuracy of the proposed framework, and real data applications further validate its predictive performance.",

      "abstract": "Accurate forecasting of infectious disease dynamics is critical for public health planning and intervention. Human mobility plays a central role in shaping the spatial spread of epidemics, but mobility data are noisy, indirect, and difficult to integrate reliably with disease records. Meanwhile, epidemic case time series are typically short and reported at coarse temporal resolution. These conditions limit the effectiveness of parameter-heavy mobility-aware forecasters that rely on clean and abundant data. In this work, we propose the Mobility-Informed Causal Adapter (MiCA), a lightweight and architecture-agnostic module for epidemic forecasting. MiCA infers mobility relations through causal discovery and integrates them into temporal forecasting models via gated residual mixing. This design allows lightweight forecasters to selectively exploit mobility-derived spatial structure while remaining robust under noisy and data-limited conditions, without introducing heavy relational components such as graph neural networks or full attention. Extensive experiments on four real-world epidemic datasets, including COVID-19 incidence, COVID-19 mortality, influenza, and dengue, show that MiCA consistently improves lightweight temporal backbones, achieving an average relative error reduction of 7.5\\% across forecasting horizons. Moreover, MiCA attains performance competitive with SOTA spatio-temporal models while remaining lightweight.",

However, in clinical practice, it is difficult to collect the large amount of CT images for specific cases, such as small cell carcinoma with low epidemiological incidence or benign tumors that are difficult to distinguish from malignant ones. This leads to the challenge of data imbalance. In this study, to address this issue, we proposed a method to automatically generate chest CT nodule images that capture target features using latent diffusion models (LDM) and verified its effectiveness. Using the LIDC-IDRI dataset, we created pairs of nodule images and finding-based text prompts based on physician evaluations. For the image generation models, we used Stable Diffusion version 1.5 (SDv1) and 2.0 (SDv2), which are types of LDM. Each model was fine-tuned using the created dataset. During the generation process, we adjusted the guidance scale (GS), which indicates the fidelity to the input text. Both quantitative and subjective evaluations showed that SDv2 (GS = 5) achieved the best performance in terms of image quality, diversity, and text consistency. In the subjective evaluation, no statistically significant differences were observed between the generated images and real images, confirming that the quality was equivalent to real clinical images. We proposed a method for generating chest CT nodule images based on input text using LDM. Evaluation results demonstrated that the proposed method could generate high-quality images that successfully capture specific medical features.",

To accomplish this task more effectively, robots need to actively adapt support strategies throughout the long-horizon assembly process, while also generalizing across diverse part geometries. We propose A3D, a framework which learns adaptive affordances to identify optimal support and stabilization locations on furniture parts. The method employs dense point-level geometric representations to model part interaction patterns, enabling generalization across varied geometries. To handle evolving assembly states, we introduce an adaptive module that uses interaction feedback to dynamically adjust support strategies during assembly based on previous interactions. We establish a simulation environment featuring 50 diverse parts across 8 furniture types, designed for dual-arm collaboration evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that our framework generalizes effectively to diverse part geometries and furniture categories in both simulation and real-world settings.",

In this study, we constructed a visual question answering (VQA) dataset from structured data in an open dataset and investigated an image-finding generation method for chest CT images, with the aim of enabling interactive diagnostic support that presents findings based on questions that reflect physicians' interests rather than fixed descriptions. In this study, chest CT images included in the Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI) datasets were used. Regions of interest surrounding the pulmonary nodules were extracted from these images, and image findings and questions were defined based on morphological characteristics recorded in the database. A dataset comprising pairs of cropped images, corresponding questions, and image findings was constructed, and the VQA model was fine-tuned on it. Language evaluation metrics such as BLEU were used to evaluate the generated image findings. The VQA dataset constructed using the proposed method contained image findings with natural expressions as radiological descriptions. In addition, the generated image findings showed a high CIDEr score of 3.896, and a high agreement with the reference findings was obtained through evaluation based on morphological characteristics. We constructed a VQA dataset for chest CT images using structured information on the morphological characteristics from the LIDC-IDRI dataset. Methods for generating image findings in response to these questions have also been investigated. Based on the generated results and evaluation metric scores, the proposed method was effective as an interactive diagnostic support system that can present image findings according to physicians' interests.",

      "abstract": "Online financial services constitute an essential component of contemporary web ecosystems, yet their openness introduces substantial exposure to fraud that harms vulnerable users and weakens trust in digital finance. Such threats have become a significant web harm that erodes societal fairness and affects the well being of online communities. However, existing detection methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle with two persistent challenges: (1) fraud camouflage, where malicious transactions mimic benign behaviors to evade detection, and (2) long-tailed data distributions, which obscure rare but critical fraudulent cases. To fill these gaps, we propose HIMVH, a Hippocampus-Inspired Multi-View Hypergraph learning model for web finance fraud detection. Specifically, drawing inspiration from the scene conflict monitoring role of the hippocampus, we design a cross-view inconsistency perception module that captures subtle discrepancies and behavioral heterogeneity across multiple transaction views. This module enables the model to identify subtle cross-view conflicts for detecting online camouflaged fraudulent behaviors. Furthermore, inspired by the match-mismatch novelty detection mechanism of the CA1 region, we introduce a novelty-aware hypergraph learning module that measures feature deviations from neighborhood expectations and adaptively reweights messages, thereby enhancing sensitivity to online rare fraud patterns in the long-tailed settings. Extensive experiments on six web-based financial fraud datasets demonstrate that HIMVH achieves 6.42\\% improvement in AUC, 9.74\\% in F1 and 39.14\\% in AP on average over 15 SOTA models.",

This study addresses this research problem and proposes a process mining approach to assess fairness in triage by linking real-life event logs with conceptual dimensions of justice. Using the MIMICEL event log (as derived from MIMIC-IV ED), we analyze time, re-do, deviation and decision as process outcomes, and evaluate the influence of age, gender, race, language and insurance using the Kruskal-Wallis, Chi-square and effect size measurements. These outcomes are mapped to justice dimensions to support the development of a conceptual framework. The results demonstrate which aspects of potential unfairness in high-acuity and sub-acute surface.

While large language models (LLMs) show promise in instruction parsing and preliminary planning, they exhibit limitations in long-term reasoning and dynamic multi-robot coordination. We propose Hierarchical Autonomous Intelligent Multi-Robot Planning(H-AIM), a novel embodied multi-robot task planning framework that addresses these issues through a three-stage cascaded architecture: 1) It leverages an LLM to parse instructions and generate Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) problem descriptions, thereby transforming commands into formal planning problems; 2) It combines the semantic reasoning of LLMs with the search capabilities of a classical planner to produce optimized action sequences; 3) It compiles the resulting plan into behavior trees for reactive control. The framework supports dynamically sized heterogeneous robot teams via a shared blackboard mechanism for communication and state synchronization. To validate our approach, we introduce the MACE-THOR benchmark dataset, comprising 42 complex tasks across 8 distinct household layouts. Experimental results demonstrate that H-AIM achieves a remarkable performance improvement, elevating the task success rate from 12% to 55% and boosting the goal condition recall from 32% to 72% against the strongest baseline, LaMMA-P.",

In a pre-registered study (N = 1,648), participants completed six classic decision-making tasks via a chatbot with dialogues of varying complexity. Participants exhibited two well-documented cognitive biases: the Framing Effect and the Status Quo Bias. Increased dialogue complexity resulted in participants reporting higher mental demand. This increase in cognitive load selectively, but significantly, increased the effect of the biases, demonstrating the load-bias interaction. We then evaluated whether LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-5, and open-source models) could predict individual decisions given demographic information and prior dialogue. While results were mixed across choice problems, LLM predictions that incorporated dialogue context were significantly more accurate in several key scenarios. Importantly, their predictions reproduced the same bias patterns and load-bias interactions observed in humans. Across all models tested, the GPT-4 family consistently aligned with human behavior, outperforming GPT-5 and open-source models in both predictive accuracy and fidelity to human-like bias patterns. These findings advance our understanding of LLMs as tools for simulating human decision-making and inform the design of conversational agents that adapt to user biases.",

      "abstract": "M3DDM provides a computationally efficient framework for video outpainting via latent diffusion modeling. However, it exhibits significant quality degradation -- manifested as spatial blur and temporal inconsistency -- under challenging scenarios characterized by limited camera motion or large outpainting regions, where inter-frame information is limited. We identify the cause as a training-inference mismatch in the masking strategy: M3DDM's training applies random mask directions and widths across frames, whereas inference requires consistent directional outpainting throughout the video. To address this, we propose M3DDM+, which applies uniform mask direction and width across all frames during training, followed by fine-tuning of the pretrained M3DDM model. Experiments demonstrate that M3DDM+ substantially improves visual fidelity and temporal coherence in information-limited scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency.

While Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer explicit grounding, existing paradigms of KG-augmented LLMs typically exhibit cognitive rigidity--applying homogeneous search strategies that render them vulnerable to instability under neighborhood noise and structural misalignment leading to reasoning stagnation. To address these challenges, we propose CoG, a training-free framework inspired by Dual-Process Theory that mimics the interplay between intuition and deliberation. First, functioning as the fast, intuitive process, the Relational Blueprint Guidance module leverages relational blueprints as interpretable soft structural constraints to rapidly stabilize the search direction against noise. Second, functioning as the prudent, analytical process, the Failure-Aware Refinement module intervenes upon encountering reasoning impasses. It triggers evidence-conditioned reflection and executes controlled backtracking to overcome reasoning stagnation.

While recent techniques leverage saliency or transformer attention, they merely address global context of the video signal by using static maps as auxiliary inputs rather than embedding context fundamentally within feature extraction of the video sequence. We present Dynamic Attention with Global Registers for Video Quality Assessment (DAGR-VQA), the first framework integrating register-token directly into a convolutional backbone for spatio-temporal, dynamic saliency prediction. By embedding learnable register tokens as global context carriers, our model enables dynamic, HVS-inspired attention, producing temporally adaptive saliency maps that track salient regions over time without explicit motion estimation. Our model integrates dynamic saliency maps with RGB inputs, capturing spatial data and analyzing it through a temporal transformer to deliver a perceptually consistent video quality assessment. Comprehensive tests conducted on the LSVQ, KonVid-1k, LIVE-VQC, and YouTube-UGC datasets show that the performance is highly competitive, surpassing the majority of top baselines. Research on ablation studies demonstrates that the integration of register tokens promotes the development of stable and temporally consistent attention mechanisms. Achieving an efficiency of 387.7 FPS at 1080p, DAGR-VQA demonstrates computational performance suitable for real-time applications like multimedia streaming systems.",

Existing approaches mitigate this issue through heuristic constraints on parameter updates, yet the mechanisms underlying such degradation remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a spectral analysis of sequential knowledge editing and show that a model's general abilities are closely associated with dominant singular directions of pretrained weight matrices. These directions are highly sensitive to perturbations and are progressively disrupted by repeated edits, closely tracking the collapse in both editing efficacy and general performance. Building on this insight, we propose REVIVE, a plug-and-play framework that stabilizes sequential editing by explicitly preserving the dominant singular subspace. REVIVE represents parameter updates in the spectral basis of the original weights and filters components that would interfere with the protected region. Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that REVIVE consistently improves editing efficacy while substantially preserving general abilities under long-horizon sequential editing, including extreme settings with up to 20,000 edits.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce SonicBench, a psychophysically grounded benchmark that systematically evaluates 12 core physical attributes across five perceptual dimensions. Unlike previous datasets, SonicBench uses a controllable generation toolbox to construct stimuli for two complementary paradigms: recognition (absolute judgment) and comparison (relative judgment). This design allows us to probe not only sensory precision but also relational reasoning capabilities, a domain where humans typically exhibit greater proficiency. Our evaluation reveals a substantial deficiency in LALMs' foundational auditory understanding; most models perform near random guessing and, contrary to human patterns, fail to show the expected advantage on comparison tasks. Furthermore, explicit reasoning yields minimal gains. However, our linear probing analysis demonstrates crucially that frozen audio encoders do successfully capture these physical cues (accuracy at least 60%), suggesting that the primary bottleneck lies in the alignment and decoding stages, where models fail to leverage the sensory signals they have already captured.",

      "abstract": "Quality of Service (QoS) prediction is one of the most fundamental problems in service computing and personalized recommendation. In the problem, there is a set of users and services, each associated with a set of descriptive features. Interactions between users and services produce feedback values, typically represented as numerical QoS metrics such as response time or availability. Given the observed feedback for a subset of user-service pairs, the goal is to predict the QoS values for the remaining pairs.\n  A key challenge in QoS prediction is the inherent sparsity of user-service interactions, as only a small subset of feedback values is typically observed. To address this, we propose a self-augmented strategy that leverages a model's own predictions for iterative refinement. In particular, we partially mask the predicted values and feed them back into the model to predict again. Building on this idea, we design a self-augmented mixture-of-experts model, where multiple expert networks iteratively and collaboratively estimate QoS values. We find that the iterative augmentation process naturally aligns with the MoE architecture by enabling inter-expert communication: in the second round, each expert receives the first-round predictions and refines its output accordingly. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing baselines and achieves competitive results.",

By incorporating implicit 3D representations with 2D detectors, we demonstrate that it is possible to efficiently restore 3D scenes from multiple corrupted images. We design the learned perceptual image patch similarity~( LPIPS) loss and the multi-view compensation loss (MVCL) to jointly optimize the rendering results of IDDR-NGP, which could aggregate information from multi-view corrupted images. All of them can be trained in an end-to-end manner to synthesize high-quality 3D scenes. To support the research on distractors removal in implicit 3D representations, we build a new benchmark dataset that consists of both synthetic and real-world distractors. To validate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP, we provide a wide range of distractors with corresponding annotated labels added to both realistic and synthetic scenes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP in removing multiple types of distractors. In addition, our approach achieves results comparable with the existing SOTA desnow methods and is capable of accurately removing both realistic and synthetic distractors.",

To address this, firstly, we introduce an enhanced Sharpe ratio-based model that incorporates all constraints into the objective function using adaptive penalty terms, transforming the original constrained problem into an unconstrained single-objective formulation. This approach preserves financial interpretability while simplifying algorithmic implementation. To efficiently solve the resulting high-dimensional optimization problem, we propose a Quantum Hybrid Differential Evolution (QHDE) algorithm, which integrates Quantum-inspired probabilistic behavior into the standard DE framework. QHDE employs a Schrodinger-inspired probabilistic mechanism for population evolution, enabling more flexible and diversified solution updates. To further enhance performance, a good point set-chaos reverse learning strategy is adopted to generate a well-dispersed initial population, and a dynamic elite pool combined with Cauchy-Gaussian hybrid perturbations strengthens global exploration and mitigates premature convergence. Experimental validation on CEC benchmarks and real-world portfolios involving 20 to 80 assets demonstrates that QHDE's performance improves by up to 73.4%. It attains faster convergence, higher solution precision, and greater robustness than seven state-of-the-art counterparts, thereby confirming its suitability for complex, high-dimensional portfolio optimization and advancing quantum-inspired evolutionary research in computational finance.",

However, existing methods still have limitations in capturing complex sequence dependencies and distinguishing confusing samples with high similarity. To address these challenges, we propose AVP-Pro, a novel two-stage predictive framework that integrates adaptive feature fusion and contrastive learning. To comprehensively capture the physicochemical properties and deep-seated patterns of peptide sequences, we constructed a panoramic feature space encompassing 10 distinct descriptors and designed a hierarchical fusion architecture. This architecture integrates self-attention and adaptive gating mechanisms to dynamically modulate the weights of local motifs extracted by CNNs and global dependencies captured by BiLSTMs based on sequence context. Targeting the blurred decision boundary caused by the high similarity between positive and negative sample sequences, we adopted an Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM)-driven contrastive learning strategy enhanced by BLOSUM62. This approach significantly sharpened the model's discriminative power. Model evaluation results show that in the first stage of general AVP identification, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.9531 and an MCC of 0.9064, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In the second stage of functional subtype prediction, combined with a transfer learning strategy, the model realized accurate classification of 6 viral families and 8 specific viruses under small-sample conditions. AVP-Pro provides a powerful and interpretable new tool for the high-throughput screening of antiviral drugs.

This adapter is trained using the proposed quantile loss. Unlike existing approaches, we correct for the distribution shift by matching high-dimensional geometric quantiles. We prove theoretically that under suitable conditions minimizing quantile loss can learn the optimal adapter. We validate our approach on CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C and TinyImageNet-C by training both classic convolutional and transformer networks on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet datasets.",

      "abstract": "Interpretable graph learning has recently emerged as a popular research topic in machine learning. The goal is to identify the important nodes and edges of an input graph that are crucial for performing a specific graph reasoning task. A number of studies have been conducted in this area, and various benchmark datasets have been proposed to facilitate evaluation. Among them, one of the most challenging is the Spurious-Motif benchmark, introduced at ICLR 2022. The datasets in this synthetic benchmark are deliberately designed to include spurious correlations, making it particularly difficult for models to distinguish truly relevant structures from misleading patterns. As a result, existing methods exhibit significantly worse performance on this benchmark compared to others.\n  In this paper, we focus on improving interpretability on the challenging Spurious-Motif datasets. We demonstrate that the self-reflection technique, commonly used in large language models to tackle complex tasks, can also be effectively adapted to enhance interpretability in datasets with strong spurious correlations. Specifically, we propose a self-reflection framework that can be integrated with existing interpretable graph learning methods. When such a method produces importance scores for each node and edge, our framework feeds these predictions back into the original method to perform a second round of evaluation. This iterative process mirrors how large language models employ self-reflective prompting to reassess their previous outputs. We further analyze the reasons behind this improvement from the perspective of graph representation learning, which motivates us to propose a fine-tuning training method based on this feedback mechanism.",

However, the role of these retrieval heads in improving model performance remains unexplored. This work investigates whether retrieval heads can be leveraged to enhance the long-context capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we propose RetMask, a method that generates training signals by contrasting normal model outputs with those from an ablated variant in which the retrieval heads are masked. This mechanism-based approach achieves substantial improvements: +2.28 points on HELMET at 128K for Llama-3.1, with +70% gains on generation with citation and +32% on passage re-ranking, while preserving performance on general tasks. Experiments across three model families reveal that the effectiveness depends on retrieval head organization: models with concentrated patterns of retrieval heads respond strongly, while those with distributed patterns show limited gains. This mechanistic relationship validates the function of retrieval heads and demonstrates that mechanistic insights can be transformed into performance enhancements.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently exhibit strong translation abilities, even without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the internal mechanisms governing this innate capability remain largely opaque. To demystify this process, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and introduce a novel framework for identifying task-specific features. Our method first recalls features that are frequently co-activated on translation inputs and then filters them for functional coherence using a PCA-based consistency metric. This framework successfully isolates a small set of **translation initiation** features. Causal interventions demonstrate that amplifying these features steers the model towards correct translation, while ablating them induces hallucinations and off-task outputs, confirming they represent a core component of the model's innate translation competency. Moving from analysis to application, we leverage this mechanistic insight to propose a new data selection strategy for efficient fine-tuning. Specifically, we prioritize training on **mechanistically hard** samples-those that fail to naturally activate the translation initiation features. Experiments show this approach significantly improves data efficiency and suppresses hallucinations. Furthermore, we find these mechanisms are transferable to larger models of the same family. Our work not only decodes a core component of the translation mechanism in LLMs but also provides a blueprint for using internal model mechanism to create more robust and efficient models.

We first introduce the causal Sinkhorn discrepancy (CSD), an entropy-regularized causal Wasserstein distance that encourages continuous transport plans while preserving the causal consistency. We then formulate a contextual DRO model with a CSD-based ambiguity set, termed Causal Sinkhorn DRO (Causal-SDRO), and derive its strong dual reformulation where the worst-case distribution is characterized as a mixture of Gibbs distributions. To solve the corresponding infinite-dimensional policy optimization, we propose the Soft Regression Forest (SRF) decision rule, which approximates optimal policies within arbitrary measurable function spaces. The SRF preserves the interpretability of classical decision trees while being fully parametric, differentiable, and Lipschitz smooth, enabling intrinsic interpretation from both global and local perspectives. To solve the Causal-SDRO with parametric decision rules, we develop an efficient stochastic compositional gradient algorithm that converges to an $\\varepsilon$-stationary point at a rate of $O(\\varepsilon^{-4})$, matching the convergence rate of standard stochastic gradient descent. Finally, we validate our method through numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance and interpretability.",

Leveraging momentum and uncertainty in the simulated physical movements, HADES enables rapid transition of proposals toward promising areas. A position discretization procedure is introduced to propose discrete protein sequences from such a continuous state system. The posterior surrogate is powered by a two-stage encoder-decoder framework to determine the structure and function relationships between mutant neighbors, consequently learning a smoothed landscape to sample from. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in in-silico evaluations across most metrics. Remarkably, our approach offers a unique advantage by leveraging the mutual constraints between protein structure and sequence, facilitating the design of protein sequences with similar structures and optimized properties.

We propose an adaptive multi-agent role-playing framework, AdaMARP, featuring an immersive message format that interleaves [Thought], (Action), <Environment>, and Speech, together with an explicit Scene Manager that governs role-playing through discrete actions (init_scene, pick_speaker, switch_scene, add_role, end) accompanied by rationales. To train these capabilities, we construct AdaRPSet for the Actor Model and AdaSMSet for supervising orchestration decisions, and introduce AdaptiveBench for trajectory-level evaluation. Experiments across multiple backbones and model scales demonstrate consistent improvements: AdaRPSet enhances character consistency, environment grounding, and narrative coherence, with an 8B actor outperforming several commercial LLMs, while AdaSMSet enables smoother scene transitions and more natural role introductions, surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5 using only a 14B LLM.",

While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is widely adopted to improve grounding, confidence calibration in RAG settings remains poorly understood. We conduct a systematic study across four benchmarks, revealing that LLMs exhibit poor calibration performance due to noisy retrieved contexts. Specifically, contradictory or irrelevant evidence tends to inflate the model's false certainty, leading to severe overconfidence. To address this, we propose NAACL Rules (Noise-AwAre Confidence CaLibration Rules) to provide a principled foundation for resolving overconfidence under noise. We further design NAACL, a noise-aware calibration framework that synthesizes supervision from about 2K HotpotQA examples guided by these rules. By performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with this data, NAACL equips models with intrinsic noise awareness without relying on stronger teacher models. Empirical results show that NAACL yields substantial gains, improving ECE scores by 10.9% in-domain and 8.0% out-of-domain. By bridging the gap between retrieval noise and verbal calibration, NAACL paves the way for both accurate and epistemically reliable LLMs.",

To evaluate both quality and word-level monotonicity, we further develop a latency-aware TTS pipeline that maps textual outputs to speech with realistic timing.

The method exploits the geometric structure of the admissible coefficient manifold, recognizing that it admits a decomposition through the null space of the boundary operator. By characterizing this manifold via a translation-invariant representation and projecting onto the kernel component, optimization is restricted to constraint-preserving directions, transforming the constrained problem into unconstrained least-squares where boundary conditions are satisfied exactly at discrete collocation points.

Performing OD under an unsupervised regime-without any information about anomalous instances in the training data-is challenging. A recently observed phenomenon, known as the inlier-memorization (IM) effect, where deep generative models (DGMs) tend to memorize inlier patterns during early training, provides a promising signal for distinguishing outliers. However, existing unsupervised approaches that rely solely on the IM effect still struggle when inliers and outliers are not well-separated or when outliers form dense clusters. To address these limitations, we incorporate active learning to selectively acquire informative labels, and propose IMBoost, a novel framework that explicitly reinforces the IM effect to improve outlier detection. Our method consists of two stages: 1) a warm-up phase that induces and promotes the IM effect, and 2) a polarization phase in which actively queried samples are used to maximize the discrepancy between inlier and outlier scores. In particular, we propose a novel query strategy and tailored loss function in the polarization phase to effectively identify informative samples and fully leverage the limited labeling budget. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that the IMBoost consistently decreases inlier risk while increasing outlier risk throughout training, thereby amplifying their separation. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that IMBoost not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art active OD methods but also requires substantially less computational cost.",

In this note we provide a short, self-contained account of constant metric scaling on arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We distinguish between quantities that change under such a scaling, including norms, distances, volume elements, and gradient magnitudes, and geometric objects that remain invariant, such as the Levi--Civita connection, geodesics, exponential and logarithmic maps, and parallel transport. We also discuss implications for Riemannian optimization, where constant metric scaling can often be interpreted as a global rescaling of step sizes rather than a modification of the underlying geometry. The goal of this note is purely expository and is intended to clarify how a global metric scale parameter can be introduced in Riemannian computation without altering the geometric structures on which these methods rely.",

      "abstract": "We study whether lightweight symbolic reasoning supervision can improve fix type classification in compact automated program repair models. Small code models are attractive for resource-constrained settings, but they typically produce only a single prediction, making it unclear whether they learn meaningful program structure or rely on shallow correlations. We propose a reasoning distillation approach in which a large teacher model provides structured symbolic reasoning tags alongside fix-type labels. These tags capture high-level causal properties of bugs without relying on free-form explanations. We train a CodeT5-based student model under label-only and reasoning-distilled settings on the IntroClass benchmark. Reasoning supervision consistently improves macro averaged performance, particularly on less frequent bug categories, without increasing model size or complexity. We further analyze the relationship between reasoning accuracy and fix-type prediction, showing that correct reasoning traces strongly correlate with correct predictions, while not fully determining them. Our results suggest that symbolic reasoning distillation is a practical way to improve interpretability and robustness in lightweight program repair models.",

Most existing data selection methods rely on static criteria, such as difficulty, uncertainty, or heuristics, and fail to model the evolving relationship between the model and the data. Inspired by the educational theory of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), we propose ZPD Detector, a data selection framework that adopts a bidirectional perspective between models and data by explicitly modeling the alignment between sample difficulty and the model's current capability. ZPD Detector integrates difficulty calibration, model capability estimation based on Item Response Theory (IRT), and a capability-difficulty matching score to dynamically identify the most informative samples at each learning stage, improving data utilization efficiency; moreover, this dynamic matching strategy provides new insights into training strategy design.

      "abstract": "Restoring critical loads after extreme events demands adaptive control to maintain distribution-grid resilience, yet uncertainty in renewable generation, limited dispatchable resources, and nonlinear dynamics make effective restoration difficult. Reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize sequential decisions under uncertainty, but standard RL often generalizes poorly and requires extensive retraining for new outage configurations or generation patterns. We propose a meta-guided gradient-free RL (MGF-RL) framework that learns a transferable initialization from historical outage experiences and rapidly adapts to unseen scenarios with minimal task-specific tuning. MGF-RL couples first-order meta-learning with evolutionary strategies, enabling scalable policy search without gradient computation while accommodating nonlinear, constrained distribution-system dynamics. Experiments on IEEE 13-bus and IEEE 123-bus test systems show that MGF-RL outperforms standard RL, MAML-based meta-RL, and model predictive control across reliability, restoration speed, and adaptation efficiency under renewable forecast errors. MGF-RL generalizes to unseen outages and renewable patterns while requiring substantially fewer fine-tuning episodes than conventional RL. We also provide sublinear regret bounds that relate adaptation efficiency to task similarity and environmental variation, supporting the empirical gains and motivating MGF-RL for real-time load restoration in renewable-rich distribution grids.",

However, existing red-teaming frameworks remain bifurcated: they either focus on rigid, script-based text attacks or lack the architectural modularity to simulate complex, multi-turn agentic exploitations. In this paper, we introduce AJAR (Adaptive Jailbreak Architecture for Red-teaming), a proof-of-concept framework designed to bridge this gap through Protocol-driven Cognitive Orchestration. Built upon the robust runtime of Petri, AJAR leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to decouple adversarial logic from the execution loop, encapsulating state-of-the-art algorithms like X-Teaming as standardized, plug-and-play services. We validate the architectural feasibility of AJAR through a controlled qualitative case study, demonstrating its ability to perform stateful backtracking within a tool-use environment. Furthermore, our preliminary exploration of the \"Agentic Gap\" reveals a complex safety dynamic: while tool usage introduces new injection vectors via code execution, the cognitive load of parameter formatting can inadvertently disrupt persona-based attacks. AJAR is open-sourced to facilitate the standardized, environment-aware evaluation of this emerging attack surface. The code and data are available at https://github.com/douyipu/ajar.",

Here, by analyzing SGD learning dynamics, we identify a nonequilibrium mechanism governing solution selection. Numerical experiments reveal a transient exploratory phase in which SGD trajectories repeatedly escape sharp valleys and transition toward flatter regions of the loss landscape. By using a tractable physical model, we show that the SGD noise reshapes the landscape into an effective potential that favors flat solutions. Crucially, we uncover a transient freezing mechanism: as training proceeds, growing energy barriers suppress inter-valley transitions and ultimately trap the dynamics within a single basin. Increasing the SGD noise strength delays this freezing, which enhances convergence to flatter minima. Together, these results provide a unified physical framework linking learning dynamics, loss-landscape geometry, and generalization, and suggest principles for the design of more effective optimization algorithms.",

Accurate forecasting of RES generation is crucial for maintaining the reliability, stability, and economic efficiency of power system operations. Traditional approaches, such as deterministic methods and stochastic programming, frequently depend on representative scenarios generated through clustering techniques like K-means. However, these methods may fail to fully capture the complex temporal dependencies and non-linear patterns within RES data. This paper introduces a multivariate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based network designed to forecast RESs generation using their real-world historical data. The proposed model effectively captures long-term dependencies and interactions between different RESs, utilizing historical data from both local and neighboring areas to enhance predictive accuracy. In the case study, we showed that the proposed forecasting approach results in lower CO2 emissions, and a more reliable supply of electric loads.",

In order to address these limitations, we propose a training-free inference-time logit intervention for controllable generation. Our approach utilizes a statistical token score table derived from z-normalized log-odds of labeled corpora to shift the decoding distribution. Empirical evaluations across three diverse datasets focusing on writing complexity, formality, and toxicity demonstrate that our method effectively steers output characteristics, confirming its broad applicability and task-agnostic nature. Our results show that statistically grounded logit steering can achieve large, consistent, and multi-task control gains: up to +47%p accuracy and 50x f1 improvement.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates the detection and classification of depressive and non-depressive states using deep learning approaches. Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that substantially affects quality of life, and early diagnosis can greatly enhance treatment effectiveness and patient care. However, conventional diagnostic methods rely heavily on self-reported assessments, which are often subjective and may lack reliability. Consequently, there is a strong need for objective and accurate techniques to identify depressive states. In this work, a deep learning based framework is proposed for the early detection of depression using EEG signals. EEG data, which capture underlying brain activity and are not influenced by external behavioral factors, can reveal subtle neural changes associated with depression. The proposed approach combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) to jointly extract spatial and temporal features from EEG recordings. The minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR) algorithm is then applied to select the most informative features, followed by classification using a fully connected neural network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves high performance in accurately identifying depressive states, with an overall accuracy of 98.74%. By effectively integrating temporal and spatial information and employing optimized feature selection, this method shows strong potential as a reliable tool for clinical applications. Overall, the proposed framework not only enables accurate early detection of depression but also has the potential to support improved treatment strategies and patient outcomes.",

Existing Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, primarily triggered via user prompts or injected retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) context, are ineffective for this new paradigm. They are fundamentally single-turn and often lack a task-oriented approach, making them conspicuous in goal-oriented workflows and unable to exploit the compounding costs of multi-turn agent-tool interactions. We introduce a stealthy, multi-turn economic DoS attack that operates at the tool layer under the guise of a correctly completed task. Our method adjusts text-visible fields and a template-governed return policy in a benign, Model Context Protocol (MCP)-compatible tool server, optimizing these edits with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) optimizer. These adjustments leave function signatures unchanged and preserve the final payload, steering the agent into prolonged, verbose tool-calling sequences using text-only notices. This compounds costs across turns, escaping single-turn caps while keeping the final answer correct to evade validation. Across six LLMs on the ToolBench and BFCL benchmarks, our attack expands tasks into trajectories exceeding 60,000 tokens, inflates costs by up to 658x, and raises energy by 100-560x. It drives GPU KV cache occupancy from <1% to 35-74% and cuts co-running throughput by approximately 50%. Because the server remains protocol-compatible and task outcomes are correct, conventional checks fail. These results elevate the agent-tool interface to a first-class security frontier, demanding a paradigm shift from validating final answers to monitoring the economic and computational cost of the entire agentic process.",

Specifically, we simulate diagnostic dialogues between two vision-language models (VLMs): a DocVLM, which generates follow-up questions based on the image and dialogue history, and a PatientVLM, which responds using a symptom profile derived from the ground-truth diagnosis. We additionally conducted a small-scale clinical validation of the synthetic symptoms generated by our framework, with licensed clinicians confirming their clinical relevance, symptom coverage, and overall realism. These findings indicate that the resulting DocVLM-PatientVLM interactions form coherent, multi-turn consultations paired with images and diagnoses, which we then use to fine-tune the DocVLM.

      "abstract": "Split learning (SL) enables collaborative training of large language models (LLMs) between resource-constrained edge devices and compute-rich servers by partitioning model computation across the network boundary. However, existing SL systems predominantly rely on first-order (FO) optimization, which requires clients to store intermediate quantities such as activations for backpropagation. This results in substantial memory overhead, largely negating benefits of model partitioning. In contrast, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization eliminates backpropagation and significantly reduces memory usage, but often suffers from slow convergence and degraded performance. In this work, we propose HOSL, a novel Hybrid-Order Split Learning framework that addresses this fundamental trade-off between memory efficiency and optimization effectiveness by strategically integrating ZO optimization on the client side with FO optimization on the server side. By employing memory-efficient ZO gradient estimation at the client, HOSL eliminates backpropagation and activation storage, reducing client memory consumption. Meanwhile, server-side FO optimization ensures fast convergence and competitive performance. Theoretically, we show that HOSL achieves a $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{d_c/TQ})$ rate, which depends on client-side model dimension $d_c$ rather than the full model dimension $d$, demonstrating that convergence improves as more computation is offloaded to the server. Extensive experiments on OPT models (125M and 1.3B parameters) across 6 tasks demonstrate that HOSL reduces client GPU memory by up to 3.7$\\times$ compared to the FO method while achieving accuracy within 0.20%-4.23% of this baseline. Furthermore, HOSL outperforms the ZO baseline by up to 15.55%, validating the effectiveness of our hybrid strategy for memory-efficient training on edge devices.",

      "abstract": "Tree canopy detection from aerial imagery is an important task for environmental monitoring, urban planning, and ecosystem analysis. Simulating real-life data annotation scarcity, the Solafune Tree Canopy Detection competition provides a small and imbalanced dataset of only 150 annotated images, posing significant challenges for training deep models without severe overfitting. In this work, we evaluate five representative architectures, YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN, DeepLabv3, Swin-UNet, and DINOv2, to assess their suitability for canopy segmentation under extreme data scarcity. Our experiments show that pretrained convolution-based models, particularly YOLOv11 and Mask R-CNN, generalize significantly better than pretrained transformer-based models. DeeplabV3, Swin-UNet and DINOv2 underperform likely due to differences between semantic and instance segmentation tasks, the high data requirements of Vision Transformers, and the lack of strong inductive biases. These findings confirm that transformer-based architectures struggle in low-data regimes without substantial pretraining or augmentation and that differences between semantic and instance segmentation further affect model performance. We provide a detailed analysis of training strategies, augmentation policies, and model behavior under the small-data constraint and demonstrate that lightweight CNN-based methods remain the most reliable for canopy detection on limited imagery.",

Using validity, reliability, reproducibility, and replicability as guides, we explore the significance of: (1) model openness, (2) model footprint, (3) training data, and (4) model architectures and fine-tuning. While ex-ante tests of validity (i.e., benchmarks) are often privileged in these discussions, we argue that social scientists cannot altogether avoid validating computational measures (ex-post). Replicability, in particular, is a more pressing guide for selecting language models. Being able to reliably replicate a particular finding that entails the use of a language model necessitates reliably reproducing a task. To this end, we propose starting with smaller, open models, and constructing delimited benchmarks to demonstrate the validity of the entire computational pipeline.",

However, while state-of-the-art models like GlossLM achieve high scores on glossing benchmarks, user studies with linguists have found critical barriers to the usefulness of such models in real-world scenarios. In particular, existing models typically generate morpheme-level glosses but assign them to whole words without predicting the actual morpheme boundaries, making the predictions less interpretable and thus untrustworthy to human annotators.\n  We conduct the first study on neural models that jointly predict interlinear glosses and the corresponding morphological segmentation from raw text. We run experiments to determine the optimal way to train models that balance segmentation and glossing accuracy, as well as the alignment between the two tasks. We extend the training corpus of GlossLM and pretrain PolyGloss, a family of seq2seq multilingual models for joint segmentation and glossing that outperforms GlossLM on glossing and beats various open-source LLMs on segmentation, glossing, and alignment. In addition, we demonstrate that PolyGloss can be quickly adapted to a new dataset via low-rank adaptation.",

To address this, we propose an Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)-guided Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate high-quality synthetic training patches.

In this paper, we address this issue by characterizing the channel-induced performance deterioration as a generalization error against unseen channels. We introduce an augmented NN model that incorporates channel statistics directly into the weight space, allowing us to derive PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds that explicitly quantifies the impact of wireless distortion. We further provide closed-form expressions for practical channels to demonstrate the tractability of these bounds. Inspired by the theoretical results, we propose a channel-aware training algorithm that minimizes a surrogate objective based on the derived bound.

      "abstract": "Learning physically meaningful spatiotemporal representations from high-resolution multivariate Earth observation data is challenging due to strong local dynamics, long-range teleconnections, multi-scale interactions, and nonstationarity. While ConvLSTM2D is a commonly used baseline, its dense convolutional gating incurs high computational cost and its strictly local receptive fields limit the modeling of long-range spatial structure and disentangled climate dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose FAConvLSTM, a Factorized-Attention ConvLSTM layer designed as a drop-in replacement for ConvLSTM2D that simultaneously improves efficiency, spatial expressiveness, and physical interpretability. FAConvLSTM factorizes recurrent gate computations using lightweight [1 times 1] bottlenecks and shared depthwise spatial mixing, substantially reducing channel complexity while preserving recurrent dynamics. Multi-scale dilated depthwise branches and squeeze-and-excitation recalibration enable efficient modeling of interacting physical processes across spatial scales, while peephole connections enhance temporal precision. To capture teleconnection-scale dependencies without incurring global attention cost, FAConvLSTM incorporates a lightweight axial spatial attention mechanism applied sparsely in time. A dedicated subspace head further produces compact per timestep embeddings refined through temporal self-attention with fixed seasonal positional encoding. Experiments on multivariate spatiotemporal climate data shows superiority demonstrating that FAConvLSTM yields more stable, interpretable, and robust latent representations than standard ConvLSTM, while significantly reducing computational overhead.",
